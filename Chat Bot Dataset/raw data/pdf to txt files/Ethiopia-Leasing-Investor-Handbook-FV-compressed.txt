USS1 billion market potential
For the past 10 consecutive years, Ethiopia has been identified as one of the fastest
growing economies in the world. During that same period, it registered consecutive GDP
growth rates of over 10.5% and is expected to sustain this course over the next three
years.
The government has made considerable inroads to attract foreign direct investment into
the country to help develop key sectors, namely its agri, health and transports sectors, as
well as to promote growth of small and medium sized businesses. It also plans to
increase its number of industrial parks to 12 aimed at creating employment and a skilled
workforce to help it become an international light manufacturing hub.
Ethiopia's key growth sectors require substantial equipment and machinery not readily
available without substantial capital, lacking by most small and medium sized
enterprises. Leasing provides a mechanism to support them to acquire equipment.
The Ethiopia Investment Commission issued investment licenses to 275 foreign projects
with a combined capital of over USS 5 billion during the 2017/18 fiscal year. That same
time period saw an increase in job opportunities for 133,000 citizens in the newly built
industrial parks and other investment ventures.
The leasing market has grown to $153.7 million by end of December 2017, serving tens
of thousands MSMEs. With an estimated potential market value of more than S1 billion
and the only financial sector open to foreign investment, Ethiopias equipment leasing
sector is ripe for investment.
We welcome you to join us.

In Ethiopia, leasing institutions are referred to as Capital Goods Finance Companies.
At present, there are seven leasing companies licensed to do leasing in Ethiopia. The
Development Bank of Ethiopia, known as DBE, and the five regional leasing companies:
Addis CGFC, Oromia CGFC, Waliya CGFC, Debub CGFC, and Kaza CGFC. In August 2019, New
York-based African Asset Finance Company became the first foreign and privately owned
company licensed to lease equipment in Ethiopia. As of end March 2019, these leasing
companies have disbursed over ETB 4 billion (SUS 140 million) through more than 9,000
leases to local MSMEs.
The aggregate sum of capital goods finance granted to and outstanding at any one time to
a single lessee shall not exceed 2.5% of the total capital of the company.
Those intending to serve lessees having met the Br 400,000,000 minimum paid-up capital
requirement, the single borrower limit to SMEs and large businesses shall not exceed 15%
and 25% of the total capital of their companies respectively.
IFC, a member of the World Bank Group, has provided global knowledge and expertise to
help strengthen the countrys operational side of leasing.

Ethiopia's financial sector
According to the National Bank of Ethiopias latest Annual Report for 2017/2018:
The Ethiopian financial sector has remained safe, sound, well capitalized and profitable. As a
result, commercial banks opened 500 new branches in 2017/18 alone which increased the
total number of branches to 4,757 from 4,257 a year ago. The banks also increased their
deposit mobilization by 23.6 percent, loan collection by 14.9 percent and loan disbursement
by 5.9 percent. Their non-performing loan was within the required ceiling of 5 percent.
Similarly, insurance companies and microfinance institutions have scaled up their services by
expanding their network and product diversification. Capital goods finance companies have
also stepped up their operations showing visible signs of improvement.

Currently, more than 16,600 healthcare centers deliver health
services in Ethiopia. The government encourages private
sector participation in quality of care and service. The
government is also working with the private sector to build
advanced tertiary care hospitals to meet domestic demand
that would otherwise be met through outbound medical
tourism, and ultimately to attract medical tourism to Ethiopia.
Opportunities: The government is keen to acquire service,
equipment, supplies, information management systems, and
knowledge and skill transfers to improve the quality of the
healthcare system. This is an opportunity for international
companies that can provide medical equipment (i. e. MRIs, CT
Scans, radiation therapy machines, and supplies, hospital
furniture, ambulances, etc. ) .

Ethiopia has consistently spent over 30% of GDP on gross fixed
capital formation in recent years, with the highest percentage
spent on the continent. As of the end of FY 2017/18, Ethiopia
had 120,171 km (74,670 miles) of all-weather roads  about
32% of the required road network in the country. In FY
2017/18, the government invested 33.9 billion Birr (51.24
billion) in road construction. The Ethiopian Roads Authority
plans to build an additional 10,000 km of roads at a cost of 41
billion Birr (51.5 billion) during the coming year. The gov't
anticipates a further expansion of the countrys road network
to 220,000 km (136,701 miles).
At the same time, the government is implementing a $2 billion
