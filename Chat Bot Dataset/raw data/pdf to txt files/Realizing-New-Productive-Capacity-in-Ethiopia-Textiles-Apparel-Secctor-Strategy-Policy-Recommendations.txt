The aim of the study was to assess the sector identify and synthesize key challenges in the sector
and develop policy recommendations to address the constraints
Context of the study
While existing sector development initiatives have resulted in an emerging dynamic and export oriented textiles and apparel industry in Ethiopia
the sector continues to face key challenges and as a result has not yet met expectations The Ethiopian Investment Commission and the Ministry
of Trade and Industry commissioned this study to build on the existing sectorspecific studies and develop policy recommendations to unleash
growth
Objectives of the study
The primary objective of this study was to assess synthetize and identify key bottlenecks faced by the Ethiopian Textile and Apparel Value Chain
and to develop and socialize policy recommendations to catalyze the sector ie whats needed More specifically there are six objectives for
this study
1 Provide overview of the global textile and apparel value chain eco system
2 Assessment of the Ethiopian Textile and Apparel valuechain and identification of key bottlenecks
3 Develop detailed policy recommendations to address key bottlenecks in the sector modeled after the template used for pharmaceutical sector
policy recommendations
4 Employ a highly consultative approach conducting field missions with key stakeholders on both the demand supply and enablingenvironment
side to test hypothesized policy recommendations
5 Construct goals and targets for improved competitiveness comparing Ethiopias current performance to benchmark countries and setting
future goals

Note 1 The full list of reports consulted is included in Annex 10
Various bottlenecks were identified across the TA VC and categorized into 6 binding issue
constraints and three thematic area constraints 12
Issue Area Main Challenges
Inefficient customs processing 17 days import time for Ethiopia 5 days for Sri Lanka leads to long lead times
A lack of standards which results in high variability in the timelines for clearing imported goods 10 of all goods shipped in one case study
were delayed directly as a result of inefficient customs handling
High inland transportation costs importing to Ethiopia is more than 5 times the cost of importing to Bangladesh inland transportation costs for
imports are about USD 5470 for Ethiopia compared to USD 1380 for Bangladesh
Banking
Access to FX
iN Shortage of foreign currency  low forex liquidity delays importation and expansion plans For exporters this shortage is driven by inability to
if retain export earnings manufacturers can only retain 30 of earned forex the remaining 70 is converted to local currency after 28 days
1 Low liquidity in the banking sector adds to challenges of high perceived risk in TA causing high interest rates 9  115 from state banks
Workforce Devt and up to 18 from private banks and long approval times for loans up to 6 months
Difficulty sourcing workers due to largely agrarian background coupled by low efficiency and productivity efficiency levels are as low as 25
compared to Bangladesh 4647
High turnover driven by low wages and lack of worker facilities in IPs eg housing and transport Some firms report turnover rates of 10
Customs others as high as 70
and Logistics
oN
IP Development
A lack of coordination across agencies in the development of plans for parks and local economic development causing poor integration with
localities
Little tailored support  incentives to meet needs of firms that surpass the typical domestic firm
A lack of guidelines to promote or measure degree of effective knowledge transfer
A lack of incentives or controls in place to regulate the subcontract market
Low quality and high cost of local products are the underlying reasons for importation of inputs across the supply chain Eg poor quality of
cotton causes losses of EUR 144000 per 100 tons of cotton
Limited technological capacity high cost of equip and low financial capability to expand for textiles firms and ginneries

 Overview
What is the concept of a Global Value Chain and Global Production network
Global Production Network
Global Commodity Chain
Elements of a Commodity Chain
As trade in intermediate goods the import content of exports grew in importance scholars adopted the Global Value Chain concept placing more emphasis on the generation and capture of value in the different stages of production
The Global Production Network concept then extended this approach by adding the full complex of intra inter and extrafirm networks to the analysis This includes the institutional context and regulatory mechanisms as well
The global value chain and global production networks concepts are used interchangeably and we will follow that convention in this study
In the 1990s scholars coined Global Commodity Chains with two components
1 Producerdriven value chain  typical of industries such as aircraft or automobiles where the producer maintains control over production
Capital and technologyintensive
Require highwage skilled labor
Rely on a closeknit network of suppliers for justintime supply of components
2 Buyerdriven value chains  common in apparel and footwear
Do not involve investment of capital or technology by the buyer
Rely on loose networks of outsourced or contracted suppliers to provide finished goods using lowwage lowskill labor
Global value chains involve a series of steps or stages from raw materials to retail to consumption and recycling At each level an ecosystem of actors comes together to complete the product and transfer it to the next level
The ecosystem involves natural and human capital goods and service providers regulators and financial institutions The value chain is characterized by asymmetries of power weak governance and positive and negative externalities
In order to ensure that the value chain serves Ethiopias economic social and environmental objectives a comprehensive and holistic strategy is necessary The key components to achieve competitive value chains in Ethiopia focus on
1 Completing joining and enhancing each link in the chain to create a healthy ecosystem
2 Ensuring backward linkages and cluster development
3 Creating opportunities for local SMEs
4 Securing technology and skill transfer
5 Raising the competitiveness of the Ethiopian export sector as a whole through the diffusion of learning
The concept of a Global Value Chain GVC and Global Production Network GPN
As trade in intermediate goods the import content of exports gained importance scholars adopted the Global Value Chain concept emphasizing the generation and capture of value in different stages of production The Global Production Network concept extended this approach incorporating intra inter and extrafirm networks along with institutional and regulatory contexts
The terms global value chain and global production networks are used interchangeably
In the 1990s scholars introduced Global Commodity Chains with two components
1 Producerdriven value chain
 Typical in industries like aircraft or automobiles where the producer maintains control over production

For the Textile and Apparel value chain in Ethiopia a holistic approach is crucial It should be viewed as a whole integral interdependent system requiring proper functioning of all its component parts for competitive value chains Emphasis should be on completing joining and enhancing each link in the chain to create a healthy ecosystem
Key considerations for Ethiopias value chains include
 Ensuring backward linkages and cluster development
 Creating opportunities for local SMEs
 Securing technology and skill transfer
Global value chains involve a series of steps from raw materials to retail consumption and recycling The ecosystem comprises natural and human capital goods and service providers regulators and financial institutions The value chain is characterized by power asymmetries weak governance and positive and negative externalities
To ensure the value chain serves Ethiopias economic social and environmental objectives a comprehensive and holistic strategy is necessary This includes raising the competitiveness of the Ethiopian export sector through the diffusion of learning
Commodity Chain  Fashion Industry
The fashion industry stands out as one of the largest and most valuecreating sectors globally In 2016 its estimated total value reached a staggering 24 trillion surpassing other major industries such as media transportation and even commercial and professional services
If we conceptualize the fashion industry as a country its market size in 2016 would rank as the seventhlargest economy globally exceeding the economies of India and Italy Despite its significant economic impact some still perceive the fashion industry as frivolous and indulgent Additionally information about the industry is often fragmented incomplete or unreliable with systematic reporting lacking across market segments product categories operating models and regions
Source The State of Fashion 2017 McKinsey and CompanyBOF
The global apparel export market was valued at USD 443 billion in 2016 employing an estimated 25 million people worldwide
Key points
 In 2015 the World Trade Organization WTO valued the global apparel export market at 445 billion marking a twofold increase from the value in 2000
 However the growth rate of the worlds apparel trade slowed down in 201516 Factors contributing to this slowdown include increasing consumer preference for discounts and the industrys low adaptability to changing consumer behavior and preferences
 In 2014 the industry employed about 25 million people globally nearly double the figure in 2000
 The apparel industry offers strong potential for high employment particularly for relatively lowskilled individuals presenting opportunities especially for women

Global trends are favorable to Ethiopias ambitions as apparel companies are increasingly
looking to source from East Africa
Recent Attractiveness of
Trends the East African Market
Recent trends point to a repositioning of global garment sourcing
Asia is the traditional powerhouse of textiles and garment manufacturing and will
likely remain so in the near future China and Bangladesh alone accounted for USD
267 billion and USD 309 billion of global textile and garment exports in 2017
By contrast all of Africa exported just USD 12 billion However buyers are looking
for new souring locations because i countries like China are increasingly focusing
on their domestic market ii rising wage rates labour disruption travel banks and
political unrest in current sourcing locations and iii increasing cost for social and
environmental disruptions
A 201516 survey of private label apparel retailers found that 37 were diversifying
their country source of supply footprint while 28 planned to diversify in the
future
According to a 2015 survey chief purchasing officers of global buyers expect to
increase the share of their purchases from SubSaharan Africa from 03 in 2015 to
28 by 2020 Moreover 70 said they expecled to start sourcing and an additional
20 said they expected to increase the value of sourcing from Ethiopia by 2020
African countries enjoy market access to large developed
markets Like leastdeveloped countries LDCs in Asia East
African countries enjoy dutyfree access to the European
Union EU through the Everything but Arms agreement Unlike
Asian LDCs African countries can also sell garments to the
United States US duty free through the African Growth and
Opportunities Act AGOA
East African countries are well positioned geographically The
Middle East and Europe are nearby and fabric and other inputs
may be shipped directly from Asia As buyers increasingly prize
delivery speed East Africas proximity will become increasingly
more important
Governments in East African countries have made efforts
to attract investment in garment production In Ethiopia and
Kenya modern industrial parks IPs have been developed with
garment industry needs in mind IP tenants enjoy lengthy tax
holidays and are often provided special access to international
inputs

Implications for Ethiopia
While Asia continues to dominate textile and garment manufacturing apparel countries are increasingly looking to East Africa particularly Ethiopia as an alternative sourcing destination
 Chinas Focus on Domestic Markets China currently responsible for nearly 33 of the sectors total exports is shifting more apparel production capacity towards its domestic market due to its substantial size and growing middle class This presents a significant opportunity for other countries to increase their share of the global market
Factors Driving the Shift in Sourcing
1 Macroeconomic Developments Shrinking labor size rising wages increased raw materials cost and shifts in foreign exchange rates are impacting sourcing decisions
2 Increasing Cost for Social and Environmental Disruptions Rising labor disputes reports of child labor poor working conditions travel bans and political unrest are pushing buyers to explore new sourcing locations
In summary the global apparel market is undergoing shifts in both production and consumption patterns with East Africa including Ethiopia emerging as a potential alternative sourcing destination Chinas focus on domestic markets and various social and environmental disruptions are influencing these changes in the industry
Preferential Trade Agreements and Geographic Advantage in East Africa
Preferential Trade Agreements
 East African countries like leastdeveloped countries LDCs in Asia benefit from dutyfree access to the European Union EU through the Everything but Arms agreement
 Additionally East African countries can sell garments to the United States US dutyfree under the African Growth and Opportunities Act AGOA providing a tariff advantage over Asian rivals
Geographic Advantage
 East African countries have a favorable geographic location being wellpositioned near the Middle East and Europe Fabric and other inputs can be shipped directly from Asia
 The proximity of East Africa to major markets such as Europe and the Middle East becomes crucial as buyers increasingly prioritize delivery speed
Implication for Ethiopia
 Africa and Ethiopia are better positioned to tap into the USA and EU markets due to these preferential trade agreements and the advantageous geographic location of East African countries
Summary of Geographic Advantage
 Djibouti in East Africa stands out with the shortest distance to WesternEastern Europe and relatively shorter distances over the Eastern USA coast making it strategically located for sourcing operations
Distance to Major Markets in days
 Djibouti to WesternEastern Europe 4547 days
 Djibouti to Eastern USA 3637 days
 China Nansha to Western coast of USA 2829 days
 Bangladesh Chittagong to Western coast of USA 2832 days
 Vietnam Haiphong to Western coast of USA 3034 days
Implication for Shipping Routes
 The map shows that Djibouti has the shortest distance to major destinations including Western and Eastern Europe and the Eastern USA coast making it a potentially strategic location for shipping routes
Global Apparel Market  GTVAC Ecosystem
The Global Textile and Apparel Value Chain GTVAC ecosystem is a multifaceted network with several interdependent links spanning various geographies It encompasses a multitude of core and support actors and for the most part operates without stringent regulations relying on the coordination of core actors
Key Components of the GTVAC Ecosystem
1 Raw Materials
 Emphasis on global cotton production consumption and price
 Fibers used in the textile and apparel industry are either natural eg cotton wool or manmade eg polyester
 Cottons market share in textiles declined from 50 in the 1990s to 26 in 2016 while noncellulosic fibers share rose from 40 in 1990 to 68 in 2016 driven by technological advancements
2 Textile Process
 Involves various stages such as ginneries yarn spinning weaving dyeing knitting and finishing
 Technological advancements and processes are crucial in transforming raw materials into usable textiles
3 Fashion Design
 Encompasses the creative and artistic aspects of designing apparel
 Involves the creation of clothing items based on trends consumer preferences and market demands
4 Consumers and Retailers
 Form the end of the value chain where finished apparel reaches the hands of consumers
 Retailers play a crucial role in marketing distribution and meeting consumer demands
5 Shipping
 Involves the transportation of goods from manufacturers to retailers and ultimately to consumers
 Efficient shipping is essential for meeting delivery timelines and customer expectations
Global Context  Raw Materials
 Natural fibers cotton wool and manmade fibers polyester are central to the textile and apparel industry
 Cottons market share declined over the years while noncellulosic fibers share increased driven by technological advancements
Agrochemicals Improved Seed Land Clearing and Labor
 These elements are part of the raw materials stage involving the cultivation and processing of natural fibers like cotton
 Agrochemicals improved seed varieties and labor contribute to the agricultural aspect of raw material production

COTTON
Production of cotton is highly laborintensive primarily grown by smallholder farmers Harvesting is significantly manual but a shift is being made to mechanical harvest
 Worlds cotton production has been increasing in absolute terms 2148 Mn tons in 201516 2305 Mn Tons in 201617 to 2538 Mn tons in 201718
 During 201718 world cotton production is projected to increase by 10 Higher cotton prices during 201617 and better cotton price ratios to other competing crops during the 2017 planting campaign resulted in the expansion of cotton area by an estimated 3 Mn ha to over 32 Mn ha
 70 of the worlds cotton is produced by 4 countries
 Producers  India China the United States and Pakistan are the worlds largest producers accounting for about 70 of global lint output ICAC 2017 During 201718 the largest gain in production of 23 to 46 Mn tons is projected in the USA Production is also projected to increase in all other major producing countries including India China Pakistan Brazil Francophone Africa and Turkey
 Exporters  In 201718 world trade of cotton is projected to remain stable at 8 Mn Tons and the USA will remain the largest exporter accounting for 40 or 31 Mn tons of world shipments
 Consumption of cotton has continued to increase in absolute terms from 2418 Mn Tons in 20152016 to 2456 Mn Tons in 201617 2522 Mn Tons in 201718
 The largest cottonproducing countries are also the largest consuming countries
 Importers  Asia concentrates about 85 of the worlds imports China was by far the top importer from 2002 to 2015 but has been surpassed by Bangladesh and Vietnam in 2016 Bangladesh will remain the largest importer in 201718 accounting for 18 or 14 Mn tons of world imports
 Brands are increasingly strict on the sustainable production of cotton the industry is making efforts to find ways to produce fiber with less land less water less energy and fewer chemicals
 While organic and fairtrade cottons remain niche products Better Cotton Initiative BCI and Cotton made in Africa CmiA both launched in 2005 are successfully expanding market opportunities for more sustainable cotton BCI production rose to 12 of global production in 2015 up from 75 in 2014 and aims to reach 30 of global production in 2020
Overview of textile process
ginning spinning weaving and knitting dyeing washing and finishing
Global Context
Cotton textile production is the most capital intensive industry in the value chain especially in the spinning weaving and finishing stages For example an integrated denim plant from spinning through fabric finishing costing roughly USD 50 million would consume the equivalent of 19200 metric tons of seed cotton annually Compare this to the capital cost of approximately 13 million USD required to process the seed cotton consumed in the denim plant
Power quality and costs along with the cost of fibre and demand for fabric are key drivers of investment and production at this stage

China dominates the world textile market emerging over the course of the last three decades followed by EU and India
Ginning process of separating cotton fibre from seeds two technologies
Roller ginning gripping and stretching fibre through rollersblades simpler slower but gentle capacity per gin stand 40 to 110 kg linthr SRDR 175225 rotobars 360 to 1000 HS rotobars
Saw Ginning Pulling fibre with saws through ribs complex faster but harsher capacity per gin stand 1800 to 3400 kg linthr
Cost Difference between Roller and Saw Ginning
Roller ginning has higher investment costs that increase with capacity and floor area but offers lower operating costs
Saw ginning benefits from economies of scale and has lower operating costs but higher capital costs
Spinning process of converting lint to yarn
Spinning operation can produce 100 cotton yarn as well as blends with polyester or other manmade fibres depending on market requirements
Two main technologies for spinning cotton yarns
Ring spinning is a versatile process suitable for a wide range of yarns from coarse to fine and superfine yarn
Openend spinning is generally used to produce coarse yarns up to Ne 30
Cost Difference between Ring and Rotor Spinning
Ring spinning has higher costs for raw material capital labour waste and auxiliary material
Rotor spinning has lower costs across these factors
Weaving knitting and finishing
It is a heavily capital intensive operations
While knitting is moderately capital intensive and is scalable down to a much smaller size than weaving knitting is rarely done as a standalone operation and is integrated with garment production

Apparel Production
The textile and garment value chain involves various stages including the production of fabrics nonfabrics sewing thread buttons interlinking printing and labeling zippers packaging and exporting carton hanger polybag etc
Production
 Initially concentrated in one geography with vertical integration
 Innovation in ICT and logistics enabled companies to break the textile and garment value chain into its component parts and disperse it across several geographies
Materials and Costing
 Materials trims packaging and washing constitute the bulk of the costing for any garment
 Competing on labor cost alone is a race to the bottom
Actors
 Suppliers in the textile and apparel value chain mostly consist of familyrun SMEs invested in quotarich countries to benefit from cheap labor quotas and generous incentives provided by host countries
Buyers
 There are three types of lead firms buyers based on their sourcing strategies and corresponding value chains
 Lead firms or buyers employ various apparel sourcing strategies
 Buyers are focusing more on branding and marketing shifting manufacturing responsibilities down the chain
 They increasingly require their suppliers to measure their environmental and social footprint
 Garment production involves various costs including fabric trims washing and packaging

Note 1 Deepdives available on the preceding sections
Deep Dive on Production
Initially garment production was concentrated in one geography vertical integration However since the 1970s companies broke down the production process into its component parts and decided where to locate each one based on competitive advantages
Goods and services were produced by vertically integrated companies that owned all stages in the production process from raw material to retail Originally this vertical integration was due to limitations in communications and logistics making it difficult to coordinate extended supply chains Vertically integrated companies were often attached to their locations employing generations of workers from the same families
Over time innovations in ICT and logistics allowed companies to disperse production geographically based on competitive advantage and value addition This shift was influenced by factors such as the availability of raw materials labor technology markets fiscal and trade incentives Today over 60 of global trade is in intermediate goods
Future Trends
 New technologies eg 3D Printing may make it possible to shift production back to final markets shortening the critical factor of time in the value chain
 Innovations in ICT and logistics have allowed companies to disperse production globally based on competitive advantage and value addition
Trend in the Geographical Distribution of Production
 Companies broke the production process down into its component parts and decided where to locate each one leading to constant reconfiguration of the textile and garment value chain TGVC
 The end of the MultiFiber Agreement MFA quota system in 1995 has contributed to the continuous evolution of the TGVC
Deep dive on production  Materials trims packaging and washing constitute the bulk of the costing for any garment competing on labor cost alone is a race to the bottom
Costing sheet for the production of Cotton Tshirts and pants
Competition should be focused on
An examination of actual costing sheets for current materials and fabric rather than labor fabrics nonfabrics sewing thread button interlinking printing and labeling zipper packaging and exporting make up the bulk of the costing for any garment and that is where big savings can be made Competing on labor costs is to compete on 15 of the total FOB cost so the potential savings are small in comparison to those for materials trims and washing
Components Total Fabric Cost Trim Costpc Washpc Packaging FOBpc Pricepc
Cotton Tshirts US 650 US 150 US 090 US 020 US 910

Secondly the more of the cost components that can be sourced locally the better That should reduce transport and administrative costs and save time It is therefore important to develop accessories trims labeling and packaging suppliers in Ethiopia This will require foreign investment in the short term but there are also opportunities for local SMEs in this regard
Implications for Ethiopia  Ethiopia has much more to gain by developing its capacity to compete in raw materials packaging and washing than in labor
Deep Dive on Suppliers  Suppliers in the textile and apparel value chain mostly consist of familyrun SMEs invested in quotarich countries to benefit from cheap labor quotas and generous incentives provided by the host countries
Quota is generally allocated to countries that had little or no export capacity characteristics of and was denied to competitive exporting nations
Input Characteristics of Suppliers in the Textile and Apparel Value Chain
 Suppliers in the textile and apparel value chain are often SMEs managed by family members rather than experienced professional managers
 The quotarich countries usually had limited or no resources raw materials textile mills dye houses washing facilities or suppliers of accessories and trims Much of the FDI went into export processing zones where companies imported all of their inputs and exported all the outputs
This forced textile and apparel companies from noquota countries eg China Hong Kong Korea and Taiwan to go abroad and relocate to quotarich countries such as Bangladesh Cambodia Guatemala Lesotho Mauritius Sri Lanka and Swaziland
The quota system that prevailed under the Multifiber Arrangement until 1994
However the FDI companies were mostly SMEs whose basic management system was only adequate for their home markets they were unprepared for the investment and labor markets in a foreign country
Apparel Factories e The textile and apparel operations would not have survived if not for the
4 availability of cheap labour quota frees and generous incentives provided
by the FDI regimes in the host countries
Garment
Implications for Ethiopia when designing incentives and marketing the investment opportunities available in the
country the aim should be to attract companies that have the capacity to manage their operations in a foreign
environment and to create decent work opportunities in their own and local supplier facilities
Deep dive on buyers There are three types of lead firms buyers based on their sourcing
strategies and their corresponding value chains
Type of Clothing Buyers
 Type of Buyers  Description  Examples 
      
 Brand Manufacturers  As the name suggests these brands are vertically integrated and engaged in manufacturing activities While some are involved all the way back to raw materials most focus on one or more stages of yarn and textile production cutting and sewing apparel and retailing Their numbers have decreased as brands opted to outsource lowervalue functions concentrating on design marketing retailing and finance Some still manufacture but utilize suppliers and manufacturers to add capacity and flexibility  VF Hanes Brands Fruit of the Loom Hugo Boss 
 Brand Marketers  More typical for prime and luxury brands that aim to protect intellectual property and maintain quality They specialize in branding and marketing but not manufacturing This category includes former brand manufacturers that sold off their production operations like Levis and those founded by designers or entrepreneurs who never engaged in production activities eg Nike or Patagonia They may or may not own their own retail outlets  Levis Nike Patagonia 
 Retailers  Divided into two subcategories those with their own label production eg Walmart Marks  Spencer Tesco and those who only sell their brands eg Gap and HM Some discount and department store retailers have their label production while others like brand marketers drive global production networks without owning manufacturing facilities  Walmart Marks  Spencer Tesco Gap HM 
Deep dive on buyers Lead firms or buyers employ many different apparel sourcing strategies

Garment Vertically integrated
Implications for Ethiopia The country should develop its supplier base from the narrowest to the widest range of functions and
services It means a shift from transactions based on pure price to trading in skills services and knowledge This means more decent
jobs higher wages more value captured in the country
Deep dive on buyers buyers are focusing more on branding and marketing and shifting both
manufacturing and non manufacturing responsibilities down the chain
fabrics non fabrics sewing thread button interlinking
printing and labelling zipper packaging and exporting
carton hanger polybag etc
Apparel Factories Output  Implications and Roles in the Value Chain
Ethiopia must brand its value chain as socially and environmentally sustainable to attract buyers and retailers looking to shift costs and functions down the value chain
 Focus on core competencies such as branding and marketing
 Construct the supply chain and impose costs and responsibilities on suppliers
 Suppliers failing to meet buyer requirements risk exclusion from the chain
Suppliers
Handling the full package gives suppliers more control over costs margins and time covering manufacturing roles procurement logistics and warehousing
 Some suppliers have developed design capacity offering endtoend services from design to delivery
 Nonmanufacturing tasks include social and environmental compliance health and safety issues chemicals management and monitoring carbon and water footprints as well as security concerns
Background
Historically the production sharing model allowed the US to focus on capitalintensive textile manufacturing while Mexico handled laborintensive assembly In Asia a full package arrangement emerged where suppliers in the region procured inputs cut sewed garments and delivered the final products to US brands
Over the years more functions have been added to the full package including trade finance and logistics
EPZ enhance competitiveness through switching from a narrow focus on cost advantages and lower standards to become champions of sustainable business UNTAD 2015
Buyers lead changing global trends exerting the greatest influence on where the industry sources
International Garment Manufacturers
Driven by buyer demands cost quality lead times compliance
Buyers draw them into new markets for instance PVH set up in Hawassa IP and attracted 14 other companies manufacturers and suppliers
Buyers influence location and involvement of various actors in the value chain
In addition to lower costs buyers focus on sustainability and compliance along with shorter lead times based on experiences in other markets and customer preferences They seek markets where
Local Garment Producers
Often have lower quality due to lower domestic supply chain requirements
Those aiming for export must meet buyer quality and compliance standards differentiating themselves based on these criteria
Auxiliary Input Providers
Sensitivity to buyer presence due to the need for high buyer concentration in an area for attractiveness
Ethiopia has few auxiliary input manufacturers most buyers import their nonfabric inputs
Raw Input Providers
Inputs starting with cotton must meet quality standards of buyers to be used in the export chain
Locally produced cotton in Ethiopia is of lower quality than imports and is largely excluded from the export value chain
Deep dive on sustainability  Environmental social and economic sustainability form the three pillars of sustainability
Sustainability
A Social
 Ability of a system to function at a defined level of social wellbeing pollution creation and nonrenewable resource depletion
B Environmental
 Ability to maintain rates of renewable resource harvest indefinitely
C Economic
 Ability to support a defined level of economic production
Deep Dive on Social Sustainability
Main export platforms in emerging markets often face highly unstable labor situations as investors frequently underestimate and fail to quantify the impact of labor and social issues
Incoming investors often underestimate and fail to quantify the impact of labor and social issues associated with their investments It is only when they reach full operating strength that they attempt to cope with symptoms of dysfunction such as latecoming absenteeism illdiscipline errors and waste strikes and labor turnover
However these coping mechanisms often lead to further conflicts as employers seldom conduct a root cause analysis to identify the real drivers of conflict Consequently they operate at low levels of efficiency and profitability constraining company revenues and workers pay
Moreover from Central America in the West to the Philippines in the East many investment zones were designed to enable tenants to achieve worldclass export performance However zone authorities often undermine these efforts by failing to provide matching social infrastructure
This issue generally stems from the division of labor in the host government The initiative to develop investment zones is usually taken by the trade or finance ministry with insufficient consultation with the ministries responsible for the labor market housing transport and social services
Result
Even in countries with a statistical oversupply of labor and attractive nominal wage rates ensuring a competitive supply of labor to zone factories can be challenging due to dysfunctional labor housing transport and other markets
Workers often struggle to adapt to the rhythm and discipline of factory work facing difficulties in reporting to work on time and maintaining worldclass efficiency consistently hour after hour and day after day

Main export platforms in emerging markets are characterized by a highly unstable labor situation as investors frequently underestimate and fail to quantify the impact of labor and social issues
 Heightened awareness on adverse effects of wasteful productionconsumption
 Growing understanding of the business case of sustainability
 Sustainable production and use of products are the new norm
 Emergence of responsible innovation amongst the largest fashion companies
 Shifting paradigm on the role and responsibility of business in society
 Emergence of sustainability standards for the garment sector
The speed of fashion is amplifying 5 fundamental problems in the industry high water consumption discharge of hazardous chemicals greenhousegas emissions waste production and violation of human rights and labor standards
Specifically for consumer products like garments the old paradigm of cradletograve is making way for cradletocradle thinking or the circular economy The importance of assessing environmental impacts across the life cycle has become crucial from resource extraction manufacturing transportation to consumption and disposal
Risk managementWith a complicated supply chain like garment there is an everincreasing need to manage ESG risks covering the workplace marketplace
community and the natural environment this is further accentuated in world where the average person can now assume a watchdog function naming and shaming
brands Brand value of buyers can be easily lost if companies in supplychains are implicated in harm to humancommunity rights child rights labor rights the
environment or caught in corrupt or anticompetitive practices The Rana Plaza disaster in Bangladesh is one stark reminder
Cost minimisation increasing need to minimize cost of production to remain competitive in the global market especially as the costs of raw materials energy and
waste handling are increasing Resource Efficiency and Cleaner Production RECP has been a tried and tested approach to help achieve that objective
Access to conventional and niche markets responding to these issues has become an area of potential differentiation and creative inspiration
Embracing circularity cradletocradle design design for recycling some of the largest fashion companies such as HM and Nike have publicly set sustainability
goals and are carrying them in practice
Example HM has programmes to refurbish or recycle old garments and Nike also unveiled its European Logistics campus in Belgium founded on responding to
sustainability challenges and maximising performance while minimising footprint
Over the last 50 years traditional argument the business of business is business has been challenged and expanded to include stakeholders  not just shareholders
Importance of partnerships and collaborative governance is widely recognised and appreciated including the global community the UN national governments civil
society academia and the private sector itself
Driven mainly by buyers most important standards include ISO 9001 for companies ISO 14001 WRAP OEKOTEX Developed countries also have ecolabels such
as the Blue Angel in Germany and the White Swan in Scandinavia
Globally consumers are a force to be reckoned with when it comes to boycotting bad companiesproducts but not much in rewarding good ones boycotting
additionally the proliferation of various standards and ecolabels has become confusing for the consumer There is a call to harmonise this space
Note For more detail refer to annex 2
Deep dive on Economic sustainability  Additionally apparel and textile sourcing countries
should aim to the extent possible drive to have a localized value chain and self sufficient export
Localised
Value Chain
Self
Sufficient
Export
Foreign invested factories should forge backward and forward linkages in to the
host economy to allow for the transfer of knowledge skill and technologies to
the local players across the chain
Local Small and Medium Enterprises should be incentivized and capacitated to
provide ancillary services to the Textile and Apparel sector
Ownership of companies should gradually shift from Foreign to local based
Import content of exports should go down and the domestic content of the
exports should rise until a country is self sufficient
Fashion Design Consumers  Retailers consumers have become more sophisticated
technology driven and harder to predict than ever with designer and retailers striving to keep up
Fashion Design
Accelerated pace of fashion is
bearing pressure on creativity
Accelerated pace of fashion industry cycles
has increased the pressures bearing down on
creativity
It used to be Fashion designers which told
consumers what to want now designers
are taking more input from the buying and
merchandising teams to react to what is
selling rather than defining what will sell
through forward looking design risks
Additionally the reduced time between
cycles has led to an increased in alleged
plagiarism as the pressure to create new
collections is as much a concern for mass
market players as it is for luxury brands
More collections and shorter design cycles
are leading to high turnover among creative
directors and putting strains on the creative
process
Ethical innovation offers a way forward
product design is being transformed by
consumers and brands who have prioritised
sustainable fashion
Consumer needs and behaviours have become
more sophisticated more technologydriven
and harder to predict than ever
Always connected and informed grown more comfortable with
mobile online interaction which allowed them to consume
apparel when where how and at price they like
Retailers
Rise of Omni channel and fast fashion require players to
adapt to higher flexibility more collections the ability
to deal with small batch sizes and quick responses
Ecommerce  increase in digitalization have decreased foot traffic
in stores modern retailers are coping by diversifying and offering
online shopping but not traditional retail channels
Always on shopping around the clock millennials are demanding
instant gratification
More demanding seeking personalization customization
increasingly becoming sophisticated harder to predict and forcing
retailers and brands to their needs rather than the other way around
Shorter lead time Even fast fashion companies are adjusting their
process to accommodate shorter design fashion they confirm
orders at the last possible moment and take delivery as soon as
possible to catch the fashion trend before it passes lead times
are under constant pressure and have fallen from 120 days to
30 days in many markets This places enormous pressure on the
manufacturers to increase productivity and efficiency while at the
same time cutting costs
More value conscious consumers increasingly becoming values
oriented 2016 McKinsey Global Institute Report estimates that
more than 65 of consumers in emerging markets actively seek
out sustainable products
Sustainable production and consumption Buyers and supplies
are increasingly monitoring and publishing their sustainability
credentials
Discount or offprice shoppers  In 2016 discount shoppers
accounted for 75 of apparel purchases across all channels Part
of the reason why consumers have been able to seek discounts and
promotions has been their uptake on ecommerce and digital tools
which has created price transparency across brands and regions
Focus on promotion and discounts traditional retailers have more
outlet stores and discount stores than fullprice shops outlet malls
set to double in number in China by 2020 Europe eg in UK six
markdown periods scheduled across the year and are also playing
out in Germany and other EU countries
Life style conscious new consumer lifestyle are trending driven
by casualization inclusivity eg genderless fashion plus size
fashion modest wear for Islamic consumers from Middle East and
South East Asia wellness programs
Life style responses traditionally wellness and fashion have not
been allied industries However recent trends have emerged with
Athleisure an athleticinspired way of dressing designed to be
worn for exercising street wear and day wear

Export manufacturers are exposed to custom processes and regulations twice in each order cycle  once when importing production inputs and again
when exporting finished product it is crucial that there are no delays that can cause the consignment to miss delivery deadlines since that can lead
to expensive airfreight and contractual penalties imposed by the buyer
For this reason factory management need to be able to rely on fast customs clearance times and minimum delay in order to operate efficiently ensure
that the production lines are fully loaded and that orders are completed on time
The TA VC is driven by evershortening lead times and mandatory ontime deliveries Missing a shipping schedule exposes the manufacturer to large
fines from the buyer and risks the entire order being cancelled
Additionally when delivery of raw materials is held up it can stop the production process putting workers on short time and risking the loss of skilled
workers as they migrate to factories that have work Efficient economical modes of transportation and logistics are thus critical
Operations in textiles and garment requires sufficient and reliable access to water and energy
The modern textile and apparel value chain needs constant highgrade connectivity between head office subsidiaries factories suppliers customs
transport providers and markets Disaggregated production and fast fashion both require efficient and timely information sharing Virtually all
transactions are handled via email or VOIP calls
In addition ICT also aid communication between supplier and buyers allowing for automated monitoring of orders stocks and prices travelling
through the manufacturing and shipping process  Enterprise resource planning integrates orders sourcing manufacturing account handling and
logistics thereby helping companies optimize operations In addition modern ICT tools can allow manufacturers to track units throughout the
production line in real time facilitating more effective monitoring
As more and more machinery and equipment becomes digital the connectivity of processes will increase using the Internet of Things IoT and this
calls for urgent investment in communications infrastructure and technology
Given the competitive nature of the textile and apparel industry it is essential that raw materials accessories and trims be brought together in factories
on a timely basis The increasing pressure on suppliers to shorten their delivery times and operate on a justintime basis makes the planning and
timing of material inputs purchase critical to success Where materials are imported any delays in accessing Forex and Trade finance impacts the
competitiveness and profitability of exporters
In summary GTAVC is under threat of disruptions owing to five major factors  the future of
GTAVC is shorter faster more responsive more flexible and more sustainable than before

Fourth Industrial Revolution
 Revolutionary change brought on by social and environmental concerns
 Automation and digitalization of manufacturing processes that allow infinite and immediate adjustment of machinery enabling the production process to accommodate different styles and small volumes
New Consumption Patterns and Business Models
 New consumption patterns for customized personalized and fast shopping experiences
 New business models and apps that allow customers to shop and personalize platforms such as Amazon or Taobaocom and guarantee overnight delivery
New Forms of Regulation
 Increasing consumer demand for transparency and measurement of the environmental and social cost of products have created new forms of regulations in the sector

e Early 1960s China had a particularly slow development of its national economic shortage of foreign exchange and suffered from the lack
of materials Government prioritized development of its raw materials primarily cotton together with wool linen and silk textile knitting
and chemical fibre industry Started exporting cotton the only exportable product other than coal

National Development and Reform Commission NDRC a superMinistry with 26 functional departments develops five year plans investment
strategies industrial policies and economic restructuring programmes
Singapore
e The Singapore Economic Development Board EDB was also established in 1961 to attract investment and create jobs It became the lead government
agency for planning and executing strategies to ensure Singapores position in the global economy The EDB envisions plans and delivers medium term
strategies that position Singapore as a venue for investment originally in labour intensive manufacturing and later in capital intensive and hightech
industries

 The Mauritius Development and Investment Authority MEDIA later the Mauritius Industrial Development Agency MIDA was established to develop
additional industrial zones and promote exportoriented manufacturing companies
Key Characterstics
Statutory authority with crosscutting
roles combining planning strategy and
coordination functions to promote FDI
boost exports increase jobs and upgrade
and diversify the economy
Responsibility for the mobilisation
and allocation of capital forex reform
industrial policy and investment promotion
deregulation or liberalisation and later
for dealing with externalities such as
sustainability and social responsibility
Structure function and strategies of these
agencies were not static and they evolved
along with the changing political economic
and social context in order to maintain their
relevance
There are examples of countries that developed competitive export sectors without a central coordinating agency to drive a clear
strategy
Bangladesh
but those ad hoc or unplanned strategies have limitations
 The Board of Investment BOI was merged with the Privatisation Commission to form the Bangladesh Investment Development Authority BIDA in 2016 which is the principal private investment
promotion and facilitation agency There are two industry associations one for woven products  the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association BGMEA and one for knits  the
Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and Exporters Association BKMEA that act as lobbies for the industry but issues such as RD infrastructure logistics customs sustainability and skills are
beyond their remit and receive inadequate attention
eo The Bangladesh Export Processing Zones Authority has done a reasonable job of managing the EPZs but they have only developed eight zones in 30 years with a total of 497 tenants
Bangladesh saw impressive growth in apparel exports from both locally and foreign owned companies but after 40 years they have failed to upgrade or diversify their exports They are concentrated
in a small number of product categories and markets and highly vulnerable to external shocks The logistics system port and airport infrastructure are still far from competitive and customs remain
a bottleneck
2 Have backward  forward linkages been forged
te ee
The most complete and
comprehensive value chain on
the planet a model that every one
aspires to emulate
Gov applied four strategies to
develop the TA VC Bring In Go
Up Go West Go Out
Government drove the development
of the full value chain by offering
incentives that rewarded foreign
and Chinese investors who sourced
inputs locally
Government also offered incentives
to encourage the development of
local RD new technology and
higher value addition
Government promoted the
development of clusters and by
2010 there were 146 TA clusters
MFA quota required both assembly
and finishing take place in Mauritius
whereas the Lome Convention that
provided for quota and dutyfree
access to the EU market specified
that both assembly and one pre
assembly process take place in
the country As a result almost all
apparel exporters had backward
linkages to yarn or textile mills and
many were vertically integrated
US requirements taught exporters
process skills while those of the EU
market obliged them to acquire a
wider range of functional skills and
capacities
Limited supplies of cotton only
produces some 3 of the cotton
required by the TA VC relies on
neighbor India Imports of cotton
cost  US 3 Bn pa
Imported cotton Government
provided incentives for the import
of cotton and investment in textile
manufacturing to make up for the
shortage of raw materials yarn
and fabric but the industry remains
dependent on cotton imports 
800000 MT of cotton in 2012
Initially all fabric accessories and
trims had to be imported the knit
sector has developed local supply
Government has recently
incentivized other backward
linkages but investment has yet to
materialize
Vietnam
Heavily dependent on imported raw
cotton manmade fibres yarns fabrics
and accessories
Imported materials made up about 80
of the total export garment value between
2007 and 2011 and still account for
around 70 Vietham does produce
some yarn and textiles but the quantity
and quality are too low to meet export
requirements Local cotton producers
supply only 004 percent of the textile
sectors demand
There is insufficient dyeing and finishing
capacity and this acts as a major constraint
In anticipation of TPP and the EUVietnam
FTAS yarn forward rule that requires all
production steps of export apparel to be
sourced in member countries Chinese S
Korean and Taiwanese companies started
investing in yarn and textile mills 
Vietnamese SMEs are mostly sub
contractors to FDI vendors who receive
the orders from international brands and
retailers Some of the more capable SMEs
may receive FOB orders directly from
international buyers but they are limited
3 Has the sector upgraded diversified and increased value addition
i 7 Se
 Yes both as a result
of government policy
and incentives and
inclusion in global
value chains
 Gov drove the
expansion of the sector
in the 1990s and the
upgrading after 2000
The value added in the
TA VC increased 13
pa from 19802008 in
real terms
 Gov encouraged
upgrading by providing
fiscal tax rebates and
financial infrastructure
incentives
e Gov also set higher
technical standards
and targets for value
addition creating a
market for upgrading
 Because Sri Lanka was
small they did not try
to compete with volume
producers like China and
India They specialized
in higher fashion content
garments and intimates
e they used air freight
to reduce economic
distance
e They were initially
dependent on import for
exports but they started
with CMT and then
added more functions
and services to upgrade
shorten the supply chain
reduce time and cost and
extract more value
 As labor and other costs
rose some exporters
moved up the ladder
and produced higher
value added items
such as Scottish
knitwear whereas others
relocated production
to Madagascar and
continued to produce
basics relying on the
lower cost structure of
their neighbor
RMG exports are still concentrated in a
few low valueadded product categories
and essentially unchanged between
19902010
Within the dominant basics category
there has been a relative shift from
wovens to knits In the early 1990s the
ratio of wovens to knits was 8515 but
by 2015 it had become almost 5050
mainly because of the stronger backward
linkages in the knitwear subsector
2001 and 2010 the average unit price of
RMG exports fell by US 638doz for
knits and by US 1216doz for wovens
Unclear if Bangladesh will remain
competitive in lowmargin sectors which
are highly price sensitive Bangladesh
may start to lose price competitiveness
and hence orders as it invests to improve
factory safety and workers welfare
Additionally upgrading to higher fashion
content is difficult as it is far from major
markets and lead times are too long They
may however be able to do higher value
added constructed garments that are not
fashion sensitive
 2015 UNIDO study reported that while
Vietnam had experienced impressive
growth in exports the amount of value
added fell by half from 203 to 132
between 2006 and 2013
70 of the 2500 garment exporters are
working on a CMT basis at the bottom
of the value chain and only some 20
are doing FOB production Some 9
are doing original design manufacturing
ODM and 1 are engaged in original
brand manufacturing OBM
High  of SMEs and old SOEs in the
sector are holding back investment in
upgrading and diversification
Additionally lack of upgrading both
technology and human resources and
import dependence are limiting the
number of fullpackage orders received
from international buyers
The added value of textiles and garments in Vietnam is
very low Vietnams role in the global supply chain does
not occupy an important position  the only advantage
Vietnam has over others is our affordable source of labour
VicePresident of the Vietnam Textile and Apparel
Association
4 Was there transfer or localization of skill and technology from FDI
 Domestic Led 
e FDI esp from Korea was important
catalyst the industry is comprised
of two parts with FDI mainly in the
EPZs and locally owned exporters
mainly in the domestic tariff area
DTA Overall some 95 of export
units are locally owned
e There has been a significant skill
and knowledge transfer Managers
 workers trained by foreign
companies mainly Korean went
on to work for other companies or
founded their own
Pressure from foreign buyers trade
unions NGOs 10s and gov led to
extensive programs of social audit
certification and reporting that led
to improvements to production
organization  management
FDI LED Limited localization
 Vietnams export growth is largely
driven by FDI and it accounts for
72 of Vietnams total exports at
present
e The same is true for the leather
and footwear sector where the
industry association LEFASO notes
that FDI manufacturers account for
over 80 of the leather and shoe
exports because Vietnameseowned
companies lack the resources to
expand production or market share
e There has not been technology or
skill transfer Localisation takes
the form of mostlyforeign vendors
placing orders with local suppliers
but this has not enabled the local
SMEs to upgrade
FDI LED Extensive localization
FDI came from Hong Kong
entrepreneurs looking to escape
quota restrictions and from India
but much of the capital for Mauritian
export production was raised locally
e Mauritian investors were prominent
and by 1995 a full 50 of the equity
involved in export production was
local
 Managers trained by foreign owned
firms went on to found local firms
e The growth of the export sector
raised total factor productivity after
1990 and well into this century
Yes thanks in part to the JointVentures
established by Martin Trust and by
companies such as YKK Esquel Triumph
Speedo and Kellwood
Sri Lanka has developed some textile
capacity and now supplies about 25
by value of its fabric needs However
the lack of raw materials high cost of
machinery and expensive electricity
discourage investment in the sector
Sri Lanka benefits from the proximity of
India and other regional suppliers of fabric
China and Hong Kong Sri Lanka has
excellent sea and air connections and a
lot of Indian cargo is actually transhipped
in Sri Lanka so frequent delivery options
existed This regional supply chain meant
that the lack of backward linkages was not
a constraint
5 What challenges did the country face across VCs
e China started with a very weak
economy in the 1970s but
prioritized textiles and apparel as
an export sector
Abundant labor meant that the
industry could grow quickly and
smart government incentives
facilitated the development of the
full value chain in clusters
e The government constantly
raises wages and standards
driving companies to upgrade
and become more productive
As a result Chinese unit labor
costs continue to fall and it has
maintained its dominant position
in the world market
e China has now embarked
on Manufacturing  2025
strategy that emphasizes
higher technology industries
and greater automation TA
will therefore shrink as a 
of total manufacturing but
remain a major player probably
concentrated on the domestic
market rather than exports
Low wages inadequate workers
accommodation poor working condition
has tainted the sector
Too far from major markets and lead times
are too long increased emphasis on speed
tomarket will make it very difficult to
upgrade
Nontariff  barriers and poor freight
connections made it difficult to reach Asian
market
Risks losing price competitiveness and
hence orders with improvements in safety 
welfare
Subcontractors that do not meet international
social labour and environmental standards
are extensively used
Infrastructure buildings roads electricity
water port logistics is weak and does not
meet international standards
Politically motivated general strikes are
frequent and may cause major disruption
Water risk is critical
Skills shortages remain The skills shortage
is estimated at 25 at all levels workers
supervisors and middlemanagement There
are about 20000 expatriates still employed in
the sector who cost some US 5 Bn annually
 Wage
High interest rates make it hard for
SMEs to access credit to finance FOB
orders
increases gov increased
minimum wage at an annual average
rate of 18 between 2010 and
2015 The rate of increase slowed
after 124 in 2016 and 73 in
2017 The monthly wage in Hanoi
and Ho Chi Minh City HCMC is
US166
The Ministry of Labors Minimum
Wage Adjustment Road Map to 2020
projects minimum wage in Region
One Hanoi and HCMC rising to
US 213 pm in 2020
Statutory social security contributions
for employers  workers add 345
to the minimum wage Social
insurance issues will probably lead
to industrial unrest over the next
decade
SMEs struggle to increase
productivity fast enough to absorb
the wage increases Ave increase in
productivity  5 Cf doubledigit
wage increases
Sri Lanka had a small
population no raw
materials limited fabric
supply and high import
tariffs on textiles It
was able to overcome
these limitations and
become a world leader
in the production of
intimates swimwear and
sportswear
The secrets of this success
were close relations and
partnerships with major
foreign brands incentives
for foreign buying
offices to locate in Sri
Lanka niche production
or specialization a
constant emphasis on
increased services and
value addition shorter
lead times and flexibility
Mauritius had thriving sugar
and tourism sectors and yet
the textile and apparel sector
was able to take off and drive
the growth of manufacturing
and diversification of the
economy Like Sri Lanka local
capital and entrepreneurs
played leading roles as did
high quality human resources
Mauritius has used skill and
welfare funds to ensure
a stable and productive
workforce
Trade agreements forced them
to develop backward linkages
and this has enabled them
to reduce lead times and
increase flexibility
Mauritius has continued to
diversify the economy fishing
finance IT and competition
for labor is intense Companies
have been importing migrant
workers and outsourcing

Big mismatch between needs of the industry and local supply results in growing trade deficits as
TA companies rely on imports for almost all of their inputs
Insufficient local supply implies reliance on export
e Local supply significantly falls short of the growing demand of the TA sector which
leads to trade deficit Local cotton is used by the few integrated textile mills while the
majority of standalone garment companies rely on imported fabrics
 Almost all nonfabric inputs such as trims accessories packaging machinery and spare
parts are imported from abroad With growth in the sector and increased production
trade deficit is a mounting problem In 2016 Ethiopia imported
 Yarn  718 Mn USD 99 synthetic yarn the rest cotton  wool yarn and very
small silk yarn
e Fabric  1486 Mn USD
 Garment  3845 Mn USD
 Most of the imports come from China and ndia which account for 91 and 5 of
the trade deficit respectively in 2016 The other major origins of import are Indonesia
Turkey Thailand Saudi Arabia and Pakistan
Leading to uncompetitive
TA companies as
it results in
 Increased cost of production
 Low productivity
 nability to meet strict lead
time requirements of the
international market and
hence loss of markets

1 Many companies prefer to import cotton because of low quality of the local production
Cottons
Ethiopian Context
 Almost all of the cotton produced for local consumption many constraints affecting cotton production
 Ginning capacity  406500 tons of lint cotton but operate at capacity utilization of only 4550
55000 tons 21 private ginneries 19 operational
Key constraints
 Misaligned incentives weak links between cotton growers and ginneries and the rest of the VC makes
it difficult to sufficiently incentivize farmers to produce cotton and at the required quality Farmers may
switch to other crops such as sesame as market prices shift leading to large fluctuations in output and
 Companies prefer local cotton as importing
involves a lot of administrative burdens and
delays including prior approval from ETIDI
 Mol
 Low quality of local cotton results in high
cost and wastage negatively impacting
productivity
 As local cotton hence fails to meet standards
OP OOOO G6 limits the investment in improved farming techniques
e Fragmented farming system provision of land is a major issue for cotton sector weak contractual companies are forced to import despite
agreements between smallholders  ginneries lengthy import processes
e Productivity varies widely depending irrigation use yields can reach 3035 ha with irrigation v  Actual comparison between local and
Ginneries rain based production yields stand at 1725 gha compared globally yield is too low Insufficient imported cotton as experienced by a
availability of inputs seeds and pesticides for rainfed cultivation and limited access to finance for
irrigated cultivation results in high cost  low production
Limited cotton variety the same type of cotton seed DP90 has been planted for the past twenty years
efforts being made to develop better varieties
Low quality due to fragmented farming system and poor production harvest and postharvest
techniques Eg knitted products require min of 28mm staple length v ave of 26mm for rainfed
cotton
Contamination biggest problem results from poor picking practices can only be detected at dyeing
stage  increased cost  delayed delivery as it implies restarting the process
vertically integrated exporter in Ethiopia
shows disadvantage of local cotton at current
quality levels
 Weight and grade unreliability lower
humidity and greater contamination makes
local cotton harder to work with

Based on the extensive assessment desk review and stakeholder consultations five categories of
binding constraints were identified 12
Category Constraint Supporting Evidence
Workforce
Customs and
Logistics
e Shortage of foreign currency  low forex liquidity delays importation and
expansion plans For exporters this shortage is driven by inability to retain export
earnings
e Low liquidity in the banking sector and high perceived risk of the TA sector
causes high interest rates and long approval times for financing
 The domestic bank system has high LC and forex conversion costs and is prone
to delays
 Majority of the population is agrarian making it difficult to source skilled workers
 Low efficiency of available labour reducing cost advantage efficiency is further
lowered by high turnover
e Institutions do not provide sufficient workers  TVET graduates are not receptive
to operator work
e Current training programs do not meet the labour demand and are not effective
at imparting soft skills
Import lead times are long and expensive compared to benchmark countries
lead times are affected by both customs clearance and logistics transportation
 Customs processing is inefficient and leads to delays in customs and port handling
e Clearance systems lacks standards timelines for clearing imported goods are
highly variable
e Inland transportation from factory to Djibouti port is expensive
 Manufacturers report waiting up to 6 months to receive
information on loan approval status
Exporters are currently allowed to retain 30 of earned forex
beyond 28 days which is insufficient for their operations
Bank conversion costs range from 5 to 7 which is
substantially higher than fees charged elsewhere eg 1 in
China 045 in Vietnam
Low average worker line efficiency  efficiency can go as low as
25 compared to 46 in Bangladesh
Turnover ranges from 10 upwards some manufacturers in
Bole Lemi industrial park indicate up to 70 turnover
 Manufacturers cite that existing training initiatives do not meet
even half of the demand
Exporting from Ethiopia is 24 times more expensive compared
to competing markets like Bangladesh
 Manufacturers indicate that containers can take up to 17 days to
arrive in Addis from Djibouti usually a 3 day journey
10 of all goods shipped in one instance were delayed directly
as a result from inefficient customs handling

 Parks have not been planneddeveloped in an integrated manner that ensures
symbiosis with neighbouring citieslocalities and access to social amenities for
workers
Parks face unreliable and expensive internet water and power although power
provision is now more consistent
e There is a lack of standards for driving social and environmental compliance
across all parks
Although ETIDI offers technical support there is limited tailored support 
incentives to meet needs of firms that surpass the typical domestic firm
There is a lack of guidelines to promote or measure degree of effective knowledge
transfer
e The subcontract market remains relatively unregulated
Garment producers import all their inputs which fails integrate the local industry
into the export supply chain
Cotton sector faces lower quality and higher prices compared to imports and
low production levels
 Ginning is hindered by outdated equipment lack of quality control processes
and high financing needs
e Locally produced auxiliary inputs do not meet quality standards of exporters
 Workers in parks do not have access to housing schools and
child care or recreational facilities etc within reasonable
distance form parks
e Hawassa plans to employ 30000 workers but plans were only
developed to create housing for 500 workers
e Hawassa is the only park that has been designed to achieve high
standards of environmental compliance
 Manufacturers cite unique challenges that go beyond support
that is currently offered
 Although incentives exist to hire expat staff manufacturers note
that the 3 year period is too short and cultural differences hinder
knowledge transfer
e Existing cotton variety slows machines causes losses of EUR
144000 for each 100 tons of cotton
Despite Ethiopia having 21 ginneries  38 vertically integrated
factories that do spinning weaving  finishing garment
producers import all inputs
 Interviews with garment producers indicate they have tried to
source auxiliary inputs locally but opted to import due to low
quality
There are also an additional three thematic areas that present opportunities for addressing the
sectors challenges
Institutional
Arrangements
e Current set of incentives dont address fundamental operational challenges that
hinder performance eg access to forex customs inefficiencies etc
e Current incentives are not performance based and its effects are difficult to
measure
 Incentives are not tailored to the specific type of stakeholder
e Pursuit of relationships with international investors has not been active and
aggressive
e As Ethiopia is still nascent in TA exports it has not yet achieved quality and
capability standards that set it apart from competitors
 TA sector is dependent on several crosscutting government institutions many
of which do not have a specific mandate to promote the sectors growth
 Although a mechanism for coordination exists across these institutions conflicting
priorities limit the ability to take specific actions
e Use of data for effective decisionmaking is limited
 Manufacturers and buyers cite appreciation for current incentives
but indicate that these are not the key drivers that draw them to
the country  they would prefer for challenges on forex customs
and logistics and workforce to be addressed
e The level of investment by buyers and manufacturers is still low
 the country did not meet its TA export targets for 2017
e Ethiopia has not yet fully built international recognition as a
goto country for higher qualitycapabilities or compliance 
Ethiopia is currently known for low wages
e Key stakeholders indicate that Ethiopia lacks an empowered
central agency with the ability to enforce decisions that can
promote the sectors growth
e Manufacturers cite that information across government
institutions is not readily accessible travel to Ethiopia is
necessary to have questions answered

ssue Area Recommendation
Challenges in accessing forex and finance continue to persist despite existing efforts to prioritize
the TA sector
Context
e There is a structural forex shortage in Ethiopia which has negatively affected textiles
and apparel investors particularly those who are not relying on CMT
 Recent government interventions have sought to address the forex availability
challenge in various ways
e Under a national directive that came into effect in early 2016 the National Bank
of Ethiopia instructed commercial banks to prioritize certain sectors for forex
allocation including the textiles and apparel sector
 In Oct 2017 a new directive increased exporters forex retention from 10 to
30
 In Oct 2017 the new directive allowed use of supplier credit for all exporters
 In spite of these efforts access to forex remains the main banking challenge facing
investors long term solutions will need to address the forex availabilityretention
issue
 Input suppliers outside of parks are especially disadvantaged  unlike those in IPs
they are paid in local currency and therefore have to depend on LCs which can take
3 months
 In addition to the challenge of forex both foreign and local firms face challenges in
accessing financing driven by liquidity shortages Local manufacturers in particular
struggle to access investment and trade financing
Workforce Dev coms  pts nr Park pot toca Capability suport  Maps to the recommendation that addresses each challenge
Binding Constraints
Financing related constraints
Local banks have difficulty meeting trade finance needs of foreign
companies due to low integration with global banking systems
2b Local TA firms face low access to finance due to low liquidity in
the banking sector They also face high perceived risk resulting in
high interest rates and long loan approval durations
 High interest rates  gov banks provide lower rates nominal
interest rates of 9  115 but private banks charge rates as
high as 18
 Long loan approval durations  local manufacturers wait up to 6
months or longer for loan approvals from state banks largely due
to the lengthy due diligence processes
Forex related constraints
Limited retention of earned forex  Firms can only retain 30 of
earned forex remaining 70 is converted to local currency after
28 days
Transactions in forex are limited to IP based manufacturers  input
suppliers outside of IPs are disincentivized from supplying exporters
as they are unable to transact in forex
Note 1 Despite binding constraints related to access to forex continuing to persist this report will focus primarily on finance related issues
Ethiopias young workforce offers high potential for the sector however specific workforce
development challenges need addressing
e Ethiopia is emerging as an attractive location for textile and apparel manufacturers as
it offers low wages and an abundant young and trainable labour force
e Ethiopia has a wide network of Technical Vocational Education and Training TVET
centers 1300 20 of which specialize in the TA sector and six universities that
provide professional education in the textiles industry
 However the sector is currently facing a structural challenge  majority of the
population is agrarian and not accustomed to factory work Only 5 employment is
in manufacturing while 80 is in agriculture
e Largely as a result of the historic agrarian focus the sector faces challenges of high
turnover absenteeism and low efficiency and productivity
 The Gok through MOIETIDI development partners and the private sector have
undertaken efforts to address these challenges through various training initiatives
Despite these initiatives factories continue to cite workforce challenges as one of the
major impediments to production
BankingAccess to FX ARRUAT GTC Customs  Logics ni Park a Local Capability sport C Maps to the recommendation that addresses each challenge
TVETs do not provide enough workers into factories despite being
an institution that is expected to meet the industry demand for
workers In addition there is a mismatch between university design
and TA sector demands
The availability of workers in the required quantity and quality
is below the industry demand  Factories have difficulty sourcing
skilled workers as most of the workforce is only beginning to shift
from a traditional agrarian society to industrial work
There is inconsistency in efficiency rates  one international factory
indicates reaching efficiency levels similar to Bangladesh 4748
while others experience rates as low as 25 Low efficiency rates
can partially be attributed to high turnover rates
Turnover is high  it can range from 10 to as high as 70 a year
for various factories
High turnover is partly due to low wages Employers cite the main
cause of worker loss to other factories as a slight increase in wages

The textiles and apparel industry is particularly sensitive to customs  logistics competitiveness
Ethiopia needs to improve both lead times and cost
Context Binding Constraints
1a A national logistics strategy has been developed however there are
e The lack of an integrated local supply chain in Ethiopia causes an overreliance on
imported inputs currently almost all of the production inputs for the Ethiopian textile
 apparel sector are imported
The export production cycle is subject to tight delivery schedules with ever shortening
lead times this places a premium on time and reliability even when goods are
imported
Given the importance of lead time customs clearance is identified by stakeholders as
one of the most important aspects of successfully doing business in Ethiopia
However high local inland transportation costs ineffective customs and port handling
as well as documentary compliance costs makes the customs and logistics services
uncompetitive with regards to cost and lead time
The Ethiopian Revenues and Customs Authority MoR is implementing various
initiatives to help solve key constraints such as the introduction of esingle window
and a customs management system
Nevertheless there are a series of underlying constraints that need to be addressed to
unleash growth in the TA sector
 BankingAccess to po wake oer EN Park a Local Capability sport C Maps to the recommendation that addresses each challenge
no national targets for competitiveness or a roadmap to meet targets
Import costs are comparatively high importing to Ethiopia is more
than 5 times the cost of importing to Bangladesh due to inefficient
customs and double handling
Customs clearance is slow and lacks efficiency and standards 77
of the time required to trade across borders is needed for document
preparation customs clearance and inspections
Logistics system is slow import cycle time from discharge to delivery
at factory typically takes 1015 days export cycle time from factory
to loading is 810 days
There are no companies offering warehousing services around the
industrial parks
 There is no system to manage ingoing and outgoing empty
containers in industrial parks currently there is a 1 to 5 imbalance
There are several initiatives underway to address customs and logistics challenges with some
initiatives specific to the TA sector
MoR is implementing an updated electronic customs management system
migrating from the older system to simplify the customs procedures facilitate
trade and ensure that all goods are declared with the correct calculation

capability to invest in new equipment lack of quality standards and
processes and underutilization of existing facilities driven by low
cotton supply and declining production
 To incorporate local players into the growth of the industry various government
entities have developed strategies to support development of upstream actors in the
sector
For example the National Cotton Development Strategy NCDS was launched and
adopted in 2017 and is expected to boost production and productivity of the cotton
industry the SME Development Plan also identifies clusters for incorporation into the
export value chain through backward linkages
 like ginning the local textiles industry is largely unable to meet
export quality
There is low quality and availability of locally produced cotton 
local cotton is also 10 more expensive than imports because of
low quality impacting processing
In spite of these strategies local actors in cotton ginning and textiles are minimally
integrated into the countrys globalsupplychainoriented plans the local supply
chain continues to largely serve the domestic market
Apparel producers and buyers cite quality differences between local production and
exporter requirements as the underlying reason for continued importation of inputs

In addition challenges in subcontracting and knowledge transfer continue to persist for domestic
firms
 Some domestic manufacturers show potential and interest in
expanding to the export market but have little tailored support and
incentive to meet their needs which surpasses the typical domestic
firm
Given that the industry is nascent Ethiopias industry is primarily dominated by local
firms but the number of domestic firms in the country is still low less than 100
 Most domestic firms are engaged in garment production focusing primarily on the
local market where they have greater flexibility when it comes quality standards and
the ability to set the price  Although there are measures in place to promote and encourage
expatriate hires eg facilitation of a 2 year work permit and income
tax exemptions there are no guidelines to promote or measure
e Currently less than 20 of domestic enterprises are involved in exporting and export 
degree of effective knowledge transfer
volumes by local enterprises are highly variable
6c Furthermore the current ecosystem does not have any incentives
or controls in place to regulate the subcontract market restrictions
imposed on the movement of duty free imported inputs outside the
industrial parks further impedes the ability of firms to engage in sub
contracting
Although most firms have some degree of interest in engaging in exports they face
many challenges around accessing finance forex and meeting buyers quality
standards
e The Ethiopian Textile Industry Development Institute ETIDI was developed to
support manufacturers and has been working with local manufacturers to help them
meet export criteria and standards
 Nevertheless a series of binding constraints remain that prevent domestic firms from
being able to fully engage in increased exports

Eaves Investment Institutional  Maps to the recommendation that addresses each challenge
As Ethiopia is still nascent in TA exports it has not yet achieved
quality and capability standards that set it apart from competitors
Ethiopia has been able to attract some large buyers eg PVH but
the level of investment by buyers and manufacturers is still low  the
country did not meet its TA export targets for 2017 and needs to
secure market to achieve its industrialization targets
Industry experts indicate that pursuit of relationships with
international investors has not been active and aggressive limiting
progress in attracting investment

Recommendation Extend forex transactions privileges to input providers outside IPs
T Extend forex transaction privileges to indirect exporters outside the IPs 
allow input producers supplying manufacturers in IPs to be paid in forex
and access duty free imports to incentivize deeper backward linkages Risks
of using forex revenue and duty free imports to support local sales can be
mitigated by
 Use inputoutput coefficients to calculate the value of imports input
manufacturers are allowed to bring in duty free to prevent using duty
free imports for sale in the local market and incentivize production for
export
e Collect annual data on the value of goods input manufacturers sell
locally versus what they export indirectly to determine the extent to which
they are allowed to be paid in forex each year sliding scale mechanism
e For input providers outside of parks financing challenges are compounded by
difficulty accessing forex  despite importing their inputs and supplying to exporters
in parks their transactions do not occur in forex limiting availability of forex
China  has used industrial parks to test changes in the banking regime which were then expanded nationally eg it opened the banking sector to foreign banks in special economic
zones SEZs first and from 1986 to 1994 allowed intercompany trading of foreign currency in SEZs in dedicated swap centres

Constraints Recommendations
 Constrained supplier credit reduces export opportunities 2 Increase the limit of supplier credit for exporting companies from 500000 USD to 1000000 USD
Currently the maximum supplier credit is limited to the total of last years exports of a
firm This limits the potential for a firm to grow its exports 1 Provide dedicated financing facilities for TA manufacturers using offtake agreements with investors as
 Low liquidity of the banking sector  while low liquidity has a broader impact beyond the collateral
TA sector it is the main challenge behind limited access to finance  e Dedicated financing facilities would ensure the TA sector is prioritized for financing in practice
 The challenge of low liquidity is compounded by high perceived risk of the TA firms by  Having offtake agreements ensures that manufacturers have market and can therefore repay their
banks resulting in high interest rates and long loan approval durations loans
 High interest rates  interest rates of 9  115 from state banks and up to 18 from e Financing facilities can be provided in the form of special purpose vehicles through local banks
private banks depending om ERUOURL of Expo revenue with bilaterals  multilaterals and development partnerseg the World Bank IFC AfDB USAID
 Long loan approval durations  waiting periods of up to 6 months or longer for loan etc providing financing to the banks to lend to firms or being more directly involved in the loan
approvals from state banks private banks are faster but charge higher interest rates management process
 As a result firms have to choose between delaying capital investments or financing  Both the availability of capital and high interest rates can be addressed through provision of lower
costlier loans many opt for the latter and use their own capital to finance growth interest rates by special purpose funds
 Access to finance constrains growth of the TA sector   As development partners view themselves as having a market development  capacity building role
 Nearly 50 of all firms in Ethiopia were estimated to be fully lacking any form of they are unlikely to provide dedicated financing facilities as long term solutions Additionally they

Recommendation Establish a human resource development fund to support with worker training
in both soft and hard skills
Source Kurivilla and Chua How Do Nations Develop Skills Lessons from the Skill Development Experiences of Singapore 2000 Enterprise Partners Stakeholder interviews
e Ethiopia faces a structural challenge to industrialization  majority of the population
is agrarian which makes it difficult to source skilled workers
 As a result the TA sector experiences various challenges
e Low rates of labour efficiency varies from factory to the next one international
factory indicates reaching efficiency levels similar to Bangladesh 4748 while
others experience rates as low as 25 Low efficiency is due to low technical
machine mechanic and electricalelectronic skill level and unfamiliarity with
factory work It limits progression to higher quality and higher fashion products
and consequently the range manufacturers can provide buyers
e Absenteeism from work resulting from poor attitudes towards work and
structural challenges eg transport
e Efforts are being made to address the skills gap through training programs supported
by partners such as the World Bank GIZ and Enterprise Partners
e Despite these efforts factories are still faced with challenges in meeting demand low
efficiency and poor soft skills from workers
Create a human resource development fund to support factories with training
Employers would pay a levy of 1 of their workers payroll towards a skills fund
to support training
 Options for deployment of funding
e Grants for training  Funding is given to preapproved public or private
training service providers who apply for funding The grants are self
sustaining because they boost employment and hence the volume of the
payroll levy Recommended option as it has low administrative burden
and has proved effective for preemployment training needed to build the
skills base
e Reimbursement for training  the fund reimburses a portion of training
expenses wellsuited for inservice training on or offsite but needs a
higher level of administration
e Train or pay schemes Exemptions from levies for firms that train workers
Not ideal as firms already provide some training
Representation the fund should have a high autonomy with employers having
majority seats on the Board to ensure the fund matches industry needs and
does not become too bureaucratic
 Implementation ETIDI is ideally placed to be in charge of approving training
organizations
 Role of TVETS TVETs could be a potential partner in delivering training but
would need support in
Developing highly specific practical and short term courses 16 months
to meet the labour demand at operator level
Equipping with the relevant machines to provide training at the scale
required
Global experience highlights how skills funds can be leveraged to improve worker skills and
efficiency
e The skills levy has been implemented in more than 60 countries and has been an effective way of encouraging companies to train and retrain their
Malaysia  The Human Resources Development Fund HRDF is an organization under the Human Resources Ministry of Malaysia with a mandate to
catalyze the development of competent local workforce A payroll levy of one percent for employers with  50 employees or 05 percent for small
enterprises that wish to participate is used for partial reimbursement of approved training expenses Those who have contributed a minimum of six months
are then eligible to claim a portion of allowable training expenses up to the limit of their levy payments for the year In addition the HRDF provides firms
with grants for developing training plans
Nigeria  The Industrial Training Fund ITF is utilized to promote and encourage the acquisition of skills in industry or commerce in Nigeria in order
to generate trained manpower sufficient to meet the needs of the economy It provides that a maximum of 50 of levy be paid to uptodate levy
contributors who satisfy laid down conditions for claiming Reimbursement The schemes ensure that training activities are spread to all levels of workers
in organizations employers training programs are relevant and effective training programs are properly implemented and evaluated training activities
according to the needs of the employers and the economy as a whole are encouraged It also provides human resource development information and
training technology services to industries to enhance their manpower capacity and inhouse training delivery effort
Singapore  The Skills Development Fund SDF support is used to support workforce upgrading programmes and to provide training grants to employers
when they send their employees to attend training Under this system an employer tax on lowskilled labour finances government grants for training
including at governmentprovided training centers The effect has been to penalize companies for longterm use of unskilled labour and incentivize
employer commitments to training The fund is run by the Singapore Workforce Development Agency WDA The WDA provides financial incentives
to companies that send their employees on training programmes that include Basic Education for Skills Training BEST Modular Skills Training MOST
Worker Improvement through Secondary Education WISE Core Skills for Effectiveness and Change COSEC and Critical Enabling Skills Training CREST
Recommendation Maximize return on investment in skills training by setting up worker service
support centers to improve retention
 High turnover in factories high turnover is partly due to low wages difficulty Establish workers support service centers in industrial parks to support
adjusting to factory life and communication barriers between workers and managers workers with adjusting to industrial life
e Specific services that would be provided to help workers make the

Recommendation Set logistics competitiveness targets around cost and lead time and develop a
roadmap to achieve targets for the sector
e Customs import lead times are long compared to countries with a strong record of
TA exports 17 days for Ethiopia compared to 5 days for Sri Lanka
PDevelop a detailed national implementation roadmap with set targets around
leadtime the roadmap would need to build on the national logistics strategy
 Set longterm sector specific competitiveness targets around lead time
Despite the development of a national logistics strategy there are no national targets  Develop an implementation plan to meet targets

understand where Ethiopia is headed
China the national logistics strategy is the responsibility of the Ministry of Transport restructured in 2008 In addition to planning policies and standards the Ministry also supervises
the implementation of plans To support the implementation process a national interministry conference on logistics brings 15 relevant agencies together once or twice per year

Recommendation Develop capacity and quality of local auxiliary industry
Capacity and quality of the local auxiliary input industry can be improved in
several ways
 Provide incentives for joint ventures and auxiliary input providers who
supply to exporting apparel manufacturers to encourage upgrading of
quality standards to meet export demand eg preferential financing and
scrapping of taxes paid on imports for auxiliary input manufacturers
e Low quality of local products drives importation of auxiliary inputs eg cartons
carton boxes zippers etc by apparel manufacturers
e Local auxiliary input providers are not exposed to the quality requirements of the
export market and lack the relationships with manufacturers to provide access to this
 Low number of both local and international input producers  international producers
are hesitant to enter the market until it achieves greater scale as they are heavily
dependent on demand from apparel manufacturers
e Bring in expatriates to conduct quality enhancement trainings for
companies that are unable to afford them
 In the long term once quality has improved consider introducing local
e Local producers lack incentives to produce for the export market since they still pay sourcing quotas for nonauxiliary inputs for apparel manufacturers
import duty as indirect exporters
 Auxiliary inputs are the easiest point in the value chain to incorporate local players in terms of both time and financial investment required For example in 2009 Bangladesh
produced only 2 of the cotton needed in the country compared to 80 of accessories
 Bangladesh supports backward linkages by providing local sourcing incentives eg 15 cash subsidy of the fabric cost to exporters sourcing fabrics locally  a similar arrangement
could be provided for auxiliary inputs in Ethiopia
 In Sri Lanka joint venture companies have enabled small firms to specialize in various services requiring handwork and helped upgrade them to a level where they are comfortable
placing orders with them This happened due to the exclusive availability of export quotas to small firms and the prohibition of quota sales which required large firms to subcontract
to smaller ones and help them upgrade their production and facilities For Ethiopia the establishment of a quota system would first need to ensure that local producers can meet
quality requirements demanded by exporting manufacturers

Recommendation Promote joint ventures in ginning and textiles to address the equipment
financing and skills gaps that reduce productivity
 BankingAccess to Pe wk pot customs  Logics  dur U QS  ocal Capability Support
The ginning sector produces low quality outputs and experiences low productivity due
to the following
 Old and outdated equipment  current equipment is old and outdated which
deteriorates the quality of cotton and seed It also increases cost of production and
maintenance
Low financial capability to invest in new equipment  new equipment requires high
capital investment Machinery imports are only duty free in the establishment phase
after which import duty is charged on machinery and spare parts Domestic industry
players also identify difficulty securing financing as a key barrier to growth
e Lack of quality standards and processes eg in handling and storage This is also
caused by low technological knowhow
 Underutilization of existing facilities driven by low cotton supply and declining
 The ginning sector is classified as a services industry and as a result does not receive
incentives available to manufacturers
Like ginning the local textiles industry is largely unable to meet export quality
requirements
e Local fabric mills are few in number and unable to supply the apparel industries
from locally produced fabric
e Value adding technologies required for the export market are not performed and
would require additional investment in machinery and technical knowledge and
skill
iven the deepseeded changes that need to be implemented in the ginning
and textiles industry in terms of equipment quality control and expertise
 Promote joint ventures in ginning and textiles
e MoTl ETIDI and EIC to facilitate introductions between foreign
investors and local ginneries to encourage joint ventures in the
ginning industry  this will ensure capital for new machinery up to
date expertise and industry knowledge is integrated while boosting
local capacity
 Joint ventures can be incentivized through fiscal incentives
e Structure foreign investment in ginning to be accompanied by cotton
e This will help ensure that cotton supply is of required quality and can
meet the demand
 Some investors entering the ginning market are also establishing
cotton farms This can be encouraged on a wider scale by offering
land incentives for investors in ginning
 Reclassify the ginning industry under manufacturing and not services to
allow access to incentives that would promote investment
e The manufacturing sector receives certain benefits eg prioritized
access to forex to facilitate imports  this would enable ginneries to
upgrade equipment
Source ETIDI Textile and apparel Technology Roadmap Stakeholder interviews
Joint ventures have successfully been executed but certain countries provide lessons on measures
to ensure host country achieves desired benefits
e Research on Pakistans cotton ginning industry indicates that with ginneries struggling with high interest rates on loans heavy taxes owners education level and old
technology joint ventures were the most suitable alternative for financial solutions which private financiers cannot necessarily be compelled to provide
China has historically pursued joint ventures in ginning  it is the worlds largest producer of cotton and silk and began to seek joint ventures when supply shortages
were hampering production and exports
e China Textile Industrial Corp has established a joint venture knitting mill in Guyana Bahamas and other projects in Nigeria Pakistan Brazil and Uganda In the
Bahamas for example partners supply raw materials and sites the Chinese provide equipment technology and management personnel In Ethiopia investment in
cotton production would likely be required to meet quality and quantity demands
 Joint ventures in other countries highlight that these could pose risks for local populations if appropriate measures are not put in place Some lessons can be drawn to
enforce measures that benefit local workers and farmers
 Protect wages of local workers  The ZambiaChina Mulungushi Textiles Company established in 1997 was a joint venture between Qingdao Textiles  Zambia
Ministry of Defence The venture rehabilitated a dilapidated industrial site and increased productivity of the ginnery However suppressed wages labour unrest
and increasing global competition led to the Chinese abandoning the investment 2006
 Prioritize investors that will develop both ginneries and cotton plantations  this will i maximize ginnery utilization and ii help to lower cotton prices to an
acceptable level but also prevent driving down of cotton prices for local farmers by international ginneries that did not own cotton plantations as has happened in
countries like Kenya Benin Tanzania and Uganda

Recommendation As a medium to long term intervention strengthen local cotton sectors
incorporation into the export supply chain
 Low quality of locally produced cotton
e Current variety is of short staple length and lower quality it slows down machines
and results in loss of EUR 144000 for each 100 tons of cotton
e Contamination due to poor handling by both farmers picking transportation
and ginneries lack of quality processes eg storage
Low availability of cotton
e Of 3 million ha of available land only 80000 ha is under cotton cultivation
30 by smallholder farmers
e While ETIDI has a goal to increase the cultivated area to 500000 ha the area
under cultivation is expected to decrease to 60000 due to farmers switching to
other crops eg sesame because of erratic weather conditions and susceptibility
of the dominant cotton variety to pests
e Security and land use rights pose challenges for investors interested in large scale
farming  clear rules on land property rights do not exist and land acquisition is a
complex and constantly shifting process causing investors to fear displacement of
occupants conflict with communities and the associated reputational risk
 High prices local cotton is 10 more expensive than imports because of low quality
impacting processing lack of transparency in pricing and low availability
Ethiopia has the advantage of having agricultural land  conditions to grow
cotton this should be maximized even though benefits to the industry will
manifest in the long term
 Revamp the existing research centre for cotton
The capabilities of the center should be enhanced to help fasttrack
growth of better cotton varieties through production of improved
seeds testing accreditation and quality assurance
e The centers mandate should include supporting training of farmers
and ginneries on best practices of handling cotton and can leveraging
ETIDIs support
 Promote FDI in cotton farming as this is likely to have higher Rol than
targeting smallholder farmers due to scale
 Work with regional authorities to streamline land lease  regulation
to encourage large scale farming by investors
e Establish clear community engagement and compensation protocols
for moving land occupants facilitate community dialogue on behalf
of investors and implement regional land ownership registration
schemes
Examples from Asia highlight that various countries prioritized different types of linkages
influenced by considerations of cost and competitive advantage
e China has the highest backward linkage coefficient of any textile and apparel manufacturing country largely supported by its cluster approach China highlights
the need for targeted and comprehensive government support that address challenges comprehensively to facilitate backward linkages
 Between the 1980s and 1990s town governments i supported local farmers to establish textile enterprises ii set up a professional team to assist local enterprises
in purchasing raw materials and selling fabric products and iii provided financing guarantees to help SMEs with outdated equipment secure financing for upgrading
China also developed supply chain cities which focused fully on the production of one item and ensured the full supply chain is present eg button cities and
sock cities
 Bangladesh has integrated backwards successfully in sectors where cost of entry was lower ie knit fabrics woven fabrics to a lesser extent and accessories
However Bangladesh imports 99 of its rawcotton
 Bangladesh imports 38 of its fabric and domestically supplies the other 62 Local suppliers meet 90 of the demand for knit fabrics and 40 of the demand
for woven fabrics for exportoriented clothing firms
 Integration in knit fabrics was faster due to i the relatively lower investment requirement and ii simpler manufacturing and process technology that could be
adopted easily A knit fabric manufacturing dyeing and finishing unit could be set up at a tenth of the cost of a woven fabric manufacturing plant
e Sri Lanka has the lowest backward linkage coefficient compared to China India Bangladesh and Vietnam
e Sri Lanka opted to prioritise high value addition for niche markets over cheap production Domestic production was unable to provide the range of material and
designs needed to accommodate the changes in demand and styles that occur several times a year for value added and fashion apparel due to cost and capacity
issues
 As a result Sri Lanka prioritized flexible importation of fabrics over full integration into the textiles industry viewing ability to from the most competitive supply
source as a key success factor
 However Sri Lanka has successfully developed backward linkages in ancillary inputs as this did not require as heavy an investment as textiles
Ethiopia should prioritize backward linkages in auxiliary inputs due to lower costs and in textiles as current customs
logistics and forex challenges reduce the viability of upgrading production without a robust local supply chain

Recommendation Promote knowledge transfer from expatriates to local employees by instituting
guidelines around expat hire
 Develop specific measures to guide hiring of expatriates in the sector Specific
measures should include
e Requirement to train a local individual as an apprentice
e Obligation for the expatriate employee to take local language and
cultural competency classes upon arrival
 When leaving the country each expat should submit a list of
employees who they have trained to take over their tasks
e Ensure that there is an optimal ratio of expat to local employees
suggest 120 foreign local
e Current regulations allow for and promote the hire of expats For example
manufacturers are allowed to hire expats who are exempt from income taxes for 2
However existing incentives focus on bringing expatriates to Ethiopia there is less
emphasis placed on ensuring that knowledge transfer takes place and a lack of
measures to determine the impact and the degree of knowledge and technology
Furthermore language and cultural barriers obstruct effective knowledge transfer  Publish and promote guidelines ETIDI and EIC in collaboration to manage
data collection on expatriate hires
Bangladesh has policy level guidelines for knowledge transfer  The2011 Bangladesh Investment Development Authority BIDA guidelines were designed as a roadmap for investing
in Bangladesh This handbook includes guides on various policy decisions including expatriate employment In order to promote knowledge transfer the handbook states that foreign
nationals must transfer their expertise to local employees within 5 years of their employment and when the foreigner leaves the country heshe must submit a list of employees
whom they have trained Additionally there is also a ratio requirement number of the expatriate employees in an industrial enterprise to local employees which states that the
ratio should not exceed 120 foreign local

Recommendation Develop regulations and approval processes to guide and control sub
contracting practices
Develop regulations and standards to develop subcontract market ensuring
that subcontracting takes place in a legal and authorized manner
e Develop specific provisions that allow for subcontracting  purpose
would be to allow for the movement of duty free imported goods outside
IPs for approved subcontractors
 Develop a system for subcontractors to obtain clearance once every two
years based on their ability to meet standards once clearance has been
obtained movement of goods outside the park to those subcontractors
shall not be restricted for the specified period
e Although the practice of subcontracting occurs the current ecosystem does not
have any incentives or controls in place to regulate the subcontract market
e Restrictions imposed on the movement of duty free imported inputs outside the
industrial parks further impedes the ability of firms to engage in subcontracting
e Although subcontracting can help build the domestic industry lack of regulations can result in a backlash effect as was the case in Bangladesh in 2012 The chain of subcontracting
has become increasingly more convoluted and in some cases there can be up to four tiers of firms with homeworkers on the lowest tier with almost no power and are difficult to
regulate In Bangladesh as the sector grew subcontracting became very common However the lack of regulation led to serious political backlash in 2012 when a fire broke out
at the Tazreen Fashions factory in Dhaka Following the fire there was paperwork found linking Tazreen to buyers such as Walmart as the effect of unauthorized subcontracting
 Regulations can help control how subcontracting takes place for example in India a notification was issued in 2003 by the Central Board of Excise and Customs specifying when
and how subcontracting can take place It outlines that subcontracting outside the zone is allowed based on the approval from a customs officer It also places limits on the amount
that can be subcontracted based on the free on board value and requires that proof of the necessity to subcontract production in a domestic tariff area be submitted as per the
discretion of the customs officer

Recommendation To be effective incentives need to be targeted  performancebased they also
need to be instruments that address key operational challenges
Global experience shows that 1 incentives that address operational challenges are
attractive to FDIs and 2 phasingout tax incentives can be successfully undertaken
 Mauritius and Malaysia are examples of successful countries attracting investment
that offer many advantages to investors other than tax breaks such as stable economic
and political conditions a well educated labour force good infrastructure open trade
for exporters dependable rule of law and effective investment promotion systems
Indonesia undertook an ambitious tax reform in 1984 The company tax rate was
reduced from 45 per cent to 35 per cent and selective tax incentives were totally
eliminated including tax holidays preferential rates special investment allowances
and selective accelerated depreciation The number of FDI projects dipped in that
year but then climbed rapidly for the rest of the decade
Similarly in China although the type and extent of incentives offered varies by
province city and zone where investment is located as these administrative units
have significant autonomy the various incentive schemes have also changed over
the years Generally the type and extent of tax exemptions and deductions are now
tied to specific performance indicators such as the size of the investment period of
operation percentage of export
introduce performancebased incentives to ensure that incentives are
specifically tied to Ethiopias national sector priorities
e Set metrics and targets
e Set national priorities as a measure of performance eg Increase
forex employment value addition local sourcing exports etc
 Set performance targets based on national priorities
 Develop a set of specific incentives tied to measurable performance
around each of the targets
 Introduce new set of incentives and phase out incentives which dont
allow for performance measures
Assess current set of incentives and identify those to be phasedout
despite the limited value add certain incentives are considered
standard and expected by manufacturers and may need to remain

Restructuring the incentives needs to be done across three layers
Across
these three layers a mix
of fiscal and
nonfiscal incentives
can be used to achieve
relevant goals
Performancebased incentives Incentives tied to a set of specifically defined national
targets which will be relevant across all types of manufacturers
Incentives that nudge investors to address their operational challenges Incentives which
are intended to nudge investors towards having them address challenges such as skills
development and infrastructure These will be relevant across all types of manufacturers
Manufacturer targeted incentives Incentives which are intended to address the specific
needs of each type of manufacturer across the supply chain These incentives should be
tailored to the manufacturer
Performancebased incentives need to be structured around specified national priorities for the

Recommendation Prioritize development of basic products in the short term while building
capacity required to produce higher fashion apparel in the long term
 As the market shifts to respond to online retail market brands who have a greater
market share lead times are becoming increasingly important  Ethiopia will need to
offer more valueadd solutions to brands to remain competitive
e Historical trends indicate that most countries that have upgraded product types from
basics to higher fashion content over long durations eg China upgraded gradually
after establishing the basics industry
e Sri Lanka and Turkey have managed to upgrade relatively quickly largely due to
strong relationships and joint ventures with brand marketers
e Overall product upgrading requires the following factors
e Increased investment in machinery and logistics  has largely done through
foreign investment Higher qualityfashion apparel experience quick changes in
demand and styles and have shorter lead times
 Developing relationships with strategic buyers 
 Building a strong skills base  higher fashion products are more complex and
require higher levels of skill to produce
Incentives Promotion Changes
Dkthiopia should take a phased approach by building capacity in basics and
using those to transition to higher fashion products
Products
e In the short term focus on achieving scale in basic items that that require
less effort to start eg basic cotton product items such as knit tshirts
woven shirts and denim products These are competitive and have future
prospects they are always in demand
 In the medium to long term use the basics platform to enhance skills 
technology in higher fashion production This will improve the industrys
resilience to the threat posed by automation production of basics is easier
to automate
e Specialisation does not limit Ethiopian apparel producers rather it helps
maximize existing potential while new capacities are developed Basic
product categories with the same style can still be produced for different
price points and levels of fashion content
Capabilities
e Conditions incountry do not currently support a shift to FOB limited
supply chain integration low access to forex despite high dependence on
imports and inefficient customs and logistics
 However as these challenges are addressed the industry should look to
go beyond CMT  assembly and offer more value add solutions eg full
supply chain management and design
Execution Incentivize both product and capability upgrading
e Offer privileges eg greenlane skills fund rebate to those who move
into higher value products
e Provide a sliding scale of incentives based on level of value add to the
production process CMT vs FOB

Recommendation Target both US and European buyers who are large enough to attract
manufacturers to invest in Ethiopia
 While AGOA provides cost advantage there is a risk that AGOA could be suspended
at any moment for different including political reasons
e US promotes domestic manufacturing and its own wellestablished cotton industry
e Ethiopia hasbeen able to attract some large buyers eg PVH but the level of investment
by buyers and manufacturers is still low  the country did not meet its TA export
targets for 2017 and needs to secure market to achieve its industrialization targets
Experience with PVH Hawassa and HM Mekelle and Bole Lemi has already
demonstrated the key role that anchor buyers play in recruiting their own suppliers
into manufacturing clusters  PVH has recruited more than ten manufacturers into
Hawassa industrial park
Ethiopia should pursued both US and European based buyers who have the
capacity to bring in manufacturers
Geographic considerations
 Seek out American companies in the short term to leverage the cost
benefits that AGOA provides Africa over Asia
 Pursue relationships with buyers in the EU in parallel longterm focus
e Europe provides geographic proximity and European buyers are
increasingly looking to move more of their manufacturing closer to
Europe
e The EU provides duty free access through the EBA scheme which
allows for duty free and quota free imports from Least Developed
Countries
e Many buyers are also looking to reduce dependence on Bangladesh
Size considerations
e Focus on buyers that are large enough to attract existing manufacturers
to invest in Ethiopia for the short term Once heavier buyer presence is
achieved focus can be expanded to include midtier retailers
 Buyersbrands to target include GAP Primark Target Macys and MS
Fashion brands to target also include American Eagle Abercrombie and
Fitch and LMVH
Source Enterprise Partners A Study for Creation in the Apparel sector in Ethiopia Stakeholder interviews
Recommendation Increase use of overseas government representation and thirdparty affiliations
to increase visibility to buyers
e Pursuit of relationships with international investors has not been active and aggressive
 While Ethiopia is making strides in compliance eg through Hawassa IP it has not yet fully built international recognition as a goto country for guaranteed compliance
DAs Ethiopia develops its niche focus and prioritizes buyersinvestors to target it can take the following actions to promote the Ethiopian brand 
Utilize overseas representation to build relationships with investors
 Use overseas Ethiopian trade missions and embassies to arrange meetings with buyers and facilitate connections between Ethiopian manufacturers across the value
chain and foreign buyers in target markets led by EIC
 Organize trainings of commercial attaches based in key target markets and trade promotion officials to coordinate collect compute and disseminate trade information
and promotion led by EIC
 Work with Ethiopian textile and apparel manufacturers to increase participation in important international fairs such as Yarn Fair Heimtextil Material World etc
Facilitate connections by creating a database to enable tracking and following up on connections made at trade fairs effectively Led by EIC
Liaise with international bodies to strengthen Ethiopias social and environmental compliance brand
e Partner with auditing and certification bodies to measure the environmental and social impact of the production cycle in various parks and EIC to play the role of
communicating compliance to prospective buyers through promotional materials led by IPDC
e Encourage Ethiopiabased companies to register with specialised platform sustainability groups eg Nordic Ecolabel and IDHs Sustainable Trade Initiative to gain more
visibility  these platforms provide vendor rating based on a suppliers reuse and reduce practices and can endorse Ethiopiabased companies to buyers led by EIC

ministry can help drive change
East Asian economies that were able to upgrade and diversify from textiles and apparel to electronics and automobiles all had a central coordinating agency or ministry that served as a
combination of thinktank policy maker and coordination mechanism for the line ministries involved
e The Ministry of International Trade and Industry MIT played a key role in developing and implementing industrial policy especially during the period of reconstruction and growth from
1950 to the 1970s
 MITI regularly monitored the needs of the industry and coordinated closely with the companies and subsectors that it was supporting Deliberation councils committees and study groups
sometimes with the big industrial associations were all used to ensure that policy reflected the ever changing reality of industry and industrial strategies were revised every one or two
years to ensure their pertinence
 MITI in addition to strategy and coordination worked on issues that were beyond the scope of companies individually or collectively such as RD infrastructure trade negotiations and
overall business environment
After Deng Xiaoping launched the openingup strategy in the late 1970s a State Council Office for Special Economic Zones and OpeningUp was created in order to conceptualize and
