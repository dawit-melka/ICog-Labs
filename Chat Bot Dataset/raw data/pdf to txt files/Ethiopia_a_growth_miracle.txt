Ethiopia's growth miracle, coupled with its large
population and significant land mass, has attracted
the attention of many international companies. Over
the last ten years, the country has achieved double-
digit growth in real terms, averaging 10.6% per year,
which is the second fastest in Africa after Angola
and even surpasses that of China (10.2%). Growth
is expected to continue at a rapid pace although
forecasts suggest that it will moderate to just over
7% over the next five years.
These growth rates are the fruit of years of
investment and reform that have seen the country
entrench economic, social and political stability.
Prior to 2004, the economy was extremely volatile,
experiencing violent contractions in 1985, 1992,
1998 and 2003, with a milder recession in 1989.
Economic vulnerability was driven by an unfortunate
blend of unfavourable weather conditions, armed
conflict and policy that undermined access to food.
The result was a series of famines, the worst of which
made world headlines in 1985.
Ethiopia has historically experienced severe droughts
more or less once every ten years". Drought, combined
with poor farming practices - including almost total
dependence on rainfed agriculture - has certainly
contributed to negative economic growth in Ethiopia
in the past, but conflict, government policy inhibiting
access to food and the excessive dependence of the
whole economy on agriculture have been far more
important drivers. Many potential investors eager to
avail themselves of the rich opportunities that Ethiopia
now offers will want to reassure themselves that past
threats to the countrys economic and political stability
belong firmly in the past, and that solid measures have
been put in place to mitigate these risks in the future.

Ethiopia A growth miracle
After more than two decades of civil war, the effects
of which were exacerbated by international conflicts
with Somalia (1977 and 1998) and Eritrea (1999)",
Ethiopia has now enjoyed more than a decade of
peace. The ruling Ethiopian Peoples Revolutionary
Democratic Front (EPRDF) - a coalition of former rebel
groups that overthrew the Derg's military dictatorship
in 1991 - commands almost total hegemony.
Ethiopia is a multiparty democracy, but in practice
there is little opposition to the EPRDF, which won
more than 90% of the vote in the 2010 elections, up
from just under 60% in 2005. The strength of this
mandate has certainly helped to make it possible for
the Ethiopian state to deliver the economic results
the country so badly needs, yielding success where a
weaker state might have failed, given the odds.
The death of Meles Zenawi in 2012, first elected as
prime minister in 1995 and who effectively led the
country for more than twenty years, has created some
uncertainty over who will lead the coalition after the
federal elections scheduled for 2015. It is not a given
that Acting Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn will
be put forward as the EPRDF candidate. However,
the consensus is that political stability, in the form
of a strong coalition government led by the EPRDF,
will prevail.

Currency stability and
exchange rate policy
The National Bank of Ethiopia operates a managed
float and has a policy of gradual depreciation of the
Birr (which is not freely convertible), with occasional
sharper adjustments reflecting changes in the parallel
market. Ethiopia was granted debt relief under the
Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative in
2001. This provided considerable support to the
balance of payments until 2011, but the overall cost
of servicing foreign debt quadrupled between 2009
and 2012,
In keeping with the primary goal of poverty alleviation,
the government prefers to use foreign exchange
reserves to help fund development programmes. Due
to this, foreign reserves are not expected to exceed
three months of import cover, and tend to be a bit
lower. Relatively low reserves and the trade deficit
have created downward pressure on the Birr for some
time, a trend that is expected to persist. However,
thanks to the central bank policy of a managed float,
the volatility of the Birr tends to be low, particularly
for an emerging market currency. Exchange controls
are strict, but processes are in place to help foreign
investors satisfy their needs for foreign currency".
New technology to speed up
inter-bank processing
Swiss-based BPC Banking Technologies has
been selected by Eth-Switch SC, a consortium
of all sixteen Ethiopian banks, to implement
an electronic transfer system that will enable
electronic transfers between banks, clearing
of cheques and sharing of automated teller
machines (ATMs). It will take a year to implement
the project, which will mark a major milestone
in the journey towards an efficient, modern
banking system.
Credit cards become more widely available
as the banking system matures
The banking system in Ethiopia is developing
quickly. One indication of this is the availability
of internationally recognised credit cards
such as Visa and Mastercard. Visa cards are
now available through two leading Ethiopian
banks, the Commercial Bank of Ethiopia and
Dashen Bank. Until recently, Dashen Bank was
the only Ethiopian bank to distribute Mastercard,
but in March 2014 Awash International
Bank (AIB) announced a partnership with
Mastercard International.

Banks in OECD countries typically use interest rates
as a mechanism for managing inflation, price stability
being their primary mandate. Capital markets in
Ethiopia are still under development. This makes it
difficult to use interest rates as a tool for managing
inflation, which has reached double-digits in six years
out of the last ten. Although the depreciation of the
Birr has contributed to price spikes, the main driver
has been food prices. Poor harvests lead to domestic
food shortages, which in turn cause local prices to
rise. At the same time, an increased need for food
imports exposes consumers to volatile international
food prices.

Dependence on agriculture has decreased significantly
since the 1980s, falling from 56% to 46% of GDP.
This still makes the sector far more dominant than is
usual elsewhere in Sub-Saharan Africa. The change in
structure has emerged due to the growth in services,
driven by an increase in financial intermediation,
public administration and retail trade, rather than
the growth that was hoped for in industry and
specifically manufacturing. As a result, more measures
to support the growth of industry - and especially
manufacturing - have been put in place and there are
indications that manufacturing is beginning to expand,
even though it is too early for the changes to be
reflected in the national accountsTM.
Ethiopia leverages its natural resource
advantage by creating fertiliser industry
Ethiopia has the third largest potassium deposit
in the world. A recent deal signed with Israeli
Chemicals Limited (ICL) Africa will see the
development of Ethiopian Allana Potashs
Danakhil deposit, expected to produce one
million tonnes of potash per year. This will help
to introduce the new fertiliser to farmers in
Ethiopia, boosting yields, and introducing a new
product for export. The Allana-ICL partnership
has already invested US$25 million of a planned
USS$642 million total investment.
The expansion of mining activity will also contribute
to reducing Ethiopia's dependence on agriculture.
In 2012 mining contributed 1.6% to GDP, and just
under 10% to export revenues. The 2009/10 Growth
and Transformation Plan aims to see this contribution
increase to 10% of national output. Until recently,
little had been invested in mapping the countrys
mineral resources, but the last decade has seen
intensifying interest from global mining companies
such as Vale, BHP Billiton and Petronas, to name
but a few. New investment has resulted in fresh
discoveries of gold, tantalum and potash reserves. In
2008 that the government began exporting opals, of
which Ethiopia is now the second largest producer in
the world.
Agriculture's share of GDP has not altered much, but
the composition of agricultural output has changed
as dramatically as its overall value has increased. This
growth has been achieved by expanding the area
of land under cultivation rather than by increasing
productivity, which remains low. It is a problem
that could and should be addressed, and solving it
is core to the current Growth and Transformation
Plan. For instance, the use of fertiliser is still
limited - even if imports of fertiliser increased from
less than US$50,000 in 2001 to nearly US$630,000
in 2012 - and dependence on rain-fed agriculture is
still high. The African Development Bank estimates
that a 1% change in average annual rainfall results
in a 0.3% change in GDP growth the following
year, reflecting the impact that changes to farming
techniques could have on the economy.

Figure 5: Evolution of the Ethiopian economy
Figure 6: Evolution of agricultural output (USS million)
Changes in the composition of agricultural output are
also reflected in the pattern of exports, which has seen
the emergence of totally new categories in the top
ten goods. For example, exports of cut flowers and
fresh vegetables were practically non-existent in 2003
but figured in the top five exports by 2012, together
making up one quarter of all exports. Although coffee
is, for the moment, still the cornerstone of exports, its
share of the total is gradually decreasing. The strategy
of diversification and focus on comparative advantage
are paying off. Over the same decade that has seen
the Birrs value relative to the dollar halved, exports
have expanded tenfold in US dollar terms.
Effective partnerships led to the birth of
rose farming in Ethiopia, along with its
twin - a functional cold chain
The Ethiopian flower industry simply did not exist
until 2005. Today, Ethiopia is the worlds second
largest supplier of roses, which make up the
lion's share of cut flower production - as well as
13% of exports, worth over US$500 million in
2012, and still growing fast. The sector employs
85,000 workers (mainly women) on more than
100 farms.
The story of Ethiopia's roses illustrates how
effective partnership between donors, the private
sector and government can be. The Ethiopian
government provided generous incentives
to attract investors, made state-owned land
available at affordable prices dose to Bole
International Airport, and initiated discussions
between producers and Ethiopian Airlines, who
leases cargo planes to the industry. The Dutch
government provided private sector investment
grants to partnerships between Dutch companies
and Ethiopian producers, who had also formed
the Ethiopia Horticultural Producers and Exporters
Association (EHPEA) to promote the sector. The
birth of Ethiopian rose farming has also served to
generate a functional cold chain.

Over the last decade, investment in Ethiopia has
ratcheted up and is now amongst the highest in the
world, relative to GDP. This is entirely necessary, since
it is estimated that the country needs to invest an
average of US$5.1bn per year in infrastructure alone
for an entire decade in order to overcome existing
constraints to development.
Investors come from a well-diversified set of
countries and in 2012, foreign direct investment (FDI)
overtook Overseas Development Assistance (ODA)
for the first time. 2012 also saw the creation of two
private equity funds specifically targeting Ethiopia for
the first time*. Obtaining more investment from the
private sector is crucial if the objectives laid out in the
Growth and Development Plan are to be achieved,
setting in motion a virtuous dircle that stands to
benefit investors, state and ordinary Ethiopians alike.
Investment comes from a well-diversified
set of countries
Vegpro Group, a Kenyan firm that is partly
backed by the International Finance Corporation
(IFC), is said to be finalising a deal to lease
and manage two packaging houses just south
of Addis Ababa. Vegpro is one of the largest
suppliers of food to supermarkets in Europe. The
company will provide farmers with seeds and
then collect produce for packaging and export
after the harvest.

Creating new industries by
integrating supply chains
Cotton production is not new to Ethiopia but
this year will see the emergence of the countrys
first organic cotton farms, to supply the textile
industry with the raw material it needs to satisfy
European demand.
By sourcing its main input locally, AYCOOM
Agricultural Development Plc - a joint
venture between Ayka Addis Textile &
Investment Group and Omo Valley Agricultural
Development Plc - will stem Ayka's increasing
need for foreign exchange to source organic
cotton abroad. In 2013 alone, Ayka spent more
than USS$3.5 million on imported organic cotton.
The new venture is expected to require an
investment of about US$40 million and will use
state-owned land leased for a nominal fee.
Turkish firm Ethiopia relocated to Ethiopia in
2010 with an investment of US$140 million. Its
expansion plans go well beyond the new joint
venture and are intended to nearly triple its
export earnings from US$56 million (just over
half of all Ethiopian textile exports) in 2012/13.
Ayka currently has five plants in the outskirts
of Addis, and is building a new facility that will
create 13,000 jobs. At present, the company has
a permanent workforce of 7,500 - a significant
share of the 40,000 workers employed in the
entire Ethiopian textile industry.
Other Turkish textile manufacturers are expected
to follow in Aykas footprints, while a number
of South Korean textile companies are planning
to set up operations in Boli Lemi industrial zone,
which is under construction.
Light manufacturing leverages fine Ethiopian
leather: a new shoe industry is born
Chinese Huajian Group started producing shoes
for the US market in 2012. Its Ethiopian plant is
based in Dukem, 30km south-west of the capital.
The company produces shoes for brands such
as Guess and Calvin Klein, and hopes to see its
exports from Ethiopia reach US$4 billion within
ten years.
Hiroki Co. Ltd recently announced that it is
setting up a US$500 million manufacturing
operation in Ethiopia, where it will produce shoes
and other luxury accessories made from leather.
For the last seven years, the Japanese
manufacturer has imported Ethiopian sheepskin
to its factory in Beijing. Hiroki is already training
Ethiopian workers at its Chinese plant, and has
brought experts from Japan to train the rest of
the staff in Ethiopia. The move to Ethiopia has
been driven by the high quality of sheepskin.
Exports of leather, which were practically
non-existent in 2003, were worth US$23 million
in 2012.
Ethiopia is one of the most
inspiring markets
Diageo acquired Ethiopian brewery Meta a few
years ago for US$225 million and invested a
further USS$50 million in the business, which is
growing by more than 50% per year and employs
over one hundred people. This growth is driven
by the expanding consumer base as more and
more people move out of poverty. And, like
firms in other sectors, Diageo is sourcing its
inputs from local sources, by working with over
1,000 farmers.

The primary goal of the Ethiopian government is to
eradicate poverty by delivering economic growth and
transforming the structure of the economy. To this
end, the government has developed three successive
blueprints that have been implemented with varying
degrees of success:
 The Sustainable Development and Poverty Reduction
Program (SDPRP), implemented from 2002/03
to 2004/05
+ The Plan for Accelerated and Sustained Development
to End Poverty (PASDEP), implemented from 2005/06
to 2009/10
+ The Growth and Transformation Plan (GTP), covering
2010/11 to 2014/15
Earlier reform programmes implemented in 1990s
focused on rehabilitating and reconstructing the
economy in the wake of the long civil war, and
incorporated both macroeconomic and structural
reforms. These took account of the fact that Ethiopia
had a centrally controlled economy with a very
limited private sector and a severely under-resourced
public service'. The plans implemented since 2002
have built on the progress made in previous years
and also benefited from the debt relief obtained by
virtue of Ethiopia reaching completion point in the
enhanced Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC)
programme. The total debt relief amounted to
just under US$2 billion, spread over 17 years from
2004 to 2021.
Ethiopia's achievements in the economic sphere are all
the more impressive when considered alongside the
ground covered with respect to human development
indicators - such as poverty reduction, health and
education - and infrastructure improvements, including
institutional infrastructure or governance.

In 1995, around 35 million Ethiopians - or just over Ethiopia has the second largest population in Africa,
60% of the population - were living in extreme after Nigeria. Along with the countrys economic

The poverty gap is a measure used to indicate the 40 7
average percentage shortfall in income for people 30 +
living in poverty. On this basis too, Ethiopia has 20
made enormous strides, narrowing the gap from 10
21% in 1995 to just 8% by 2011, with most of the 0

Although Ethiopia's rank in the Human Development
Index is still one of the lowest in the world, it
has made significant gains in terms of key health
indicators. These are summarised in the table below
and were achieved by implementing a health extension
strategy under the PASDEP plan, which saw over
33,000 health extension workers trained and deployed
in rural health centres that grew in number from 4,211
in 2004/05 to 14,416 by 2009/10. 32 new public
hospitals were built over the same period, bringing the
total number to 111. Although these achievements
are impressive, when measured as a proportion of
the population it is clear that much more remains to
be done.
Outcomes with respect to education are less clear.
The number of pupils in primary education doubled
between 2002 and 2012, and increased by 179%
in secondary education. But proportionately fewer
students actually complete primary school and the
ratio of pupils to teachers - an indicator of the quality
of education - has worsened. This has happened
despite consistent investment into training more
teachers, suggesting that, once trained, teachers might
be attracted away from education to other sectors, a
problem that is not peculiar to Ethiopia by any means.
With respect to higher education, both the number
of graduates and the number of institutions have
increased: by 2009/10 there were 200,000 students in
total (including those enrolled in both undergraduates
and post-graduate courses). By way of comparison,
this is proportionately twice the number enrolled in
universities in Kenya in 2012

In recent years, Ethiopia has made significant progress
in infrastructure, and its infrastructure
indicators compare relatively well with low-income
country peers. The country developed Ethiopia Airlines
(now one of the three main African airlines) and
associated regional air transport hubs. It has launched
an ambitious investment program to upgrade its
network of trunk roads and is establishing a modern
funding mechanism for road maintenance. Access
to water and sanitation is expanding rapidly (from a
very low base) thanks to judicious concentration on
intermediate options such as traditional latrines, wells,
boreholes and standposts.
- Africa Infrastructure Country Diagnostic
Although only 23% of Ethiopians had access to grid
electricity in 2010, power production has increased
steadily over the last ten years and is almost exclusively
sourced from clean energy in the form of hydropower
stationsi. Ethiopia has the second largest hydropower
potential in Africa, after the Democratic Republic of
the Congo and is already starting to implement its
goal of becoming a major exporter of electricity in the
region. Net potential exports could reach 26.3 TWh
per year, bringing in USSm 263, which is equivalent
to about 2% of GDP. The investment needed to
make this happen is being sourced through a variety
of channels including domestic bonds and foreign
investment from the private sector. New hydroplants
constructed in the last ten years include Tekeze (300
MW, completed in 2009), Gilgel Gibe II (420 MW)
and Tana Belese (460 MW) Completion of the
Grand Renaissance Dam will see the existing capacity
of 2,000 MW quadruple, changing the face of
East African power infrastructure forever.
Improved access to water and water storage has been
achieved by implementing a range of solutions, from
rain-water harvesting to hand-dug wells to large-scale
irrigation schemes. The housing stock has been
increased, with 213,000 units built during the PASDEP
period, leading to new enterprise and job creation.
The expansion of the construction industry has seen
imports of inputs (capital goods and materials) increase
pending the development of domestic supply.
Until 2010, investment in roads - equivalent to around
3% of GDP per year - focused on upgrading and
rehabilitating the trunk road system. However, only
10% of Ethiopia's rural population live within two
kilometres of an all-weather road, a serious challenge
considering that 76% of the total population lives in
rural areas. Solving this problem completely would
require tripling the length of the road network, and so
the strategy is to prioritise areas with high agricultural
potential in order to improve food security.
However, the construction of a 5,000km-long railway
network is now being implemented by the Ethiopian
Railways Corporation. Although the immediate priority
is to get the line between Addis Ababa and Djibouti
Port up and running - an achievement that will slash
the current cost of international freight - ultimately
the network is expected to reach every corner of
the country.

Road construction leads to new
manufacturing plant
Israeli firm AnyWay Solid Environmental Solution
first participated in a road building project
in Ethiopia seven years ago. The company
produces an environmentally-friendly chemical
product used to convert poor quality soil into a
strong impermeable layer. Stabilised earth block
construction is also used as an innovative , cost-
effective method for building low-cost housing.
As Anyway's business in Ethiopia expanded,
they reached the conclusion that they needed to
produce their product locally, and have set the
wheels in motion to establish a manufacturing
plant that they hope will enter production later

The transformation of Addis Ababa into a regional
hub for air transportation, through the upgrading of
Bole International Airport and launch of Ethiopian
Airlines has been a major success for Ethiopia. The
airline is now one of the top three in Africa and is
expanding fast.
Ethiopian Airlines - growing by 25%
per year
Founded in 1945, Ethiopian Airlines is one
of Africas big success stories and has won
numerous international awards over the years,
including repeated recognition as the best airline
in Africa. In 2011, it became the third African
member of Star Alliance after EgyptAir and
South African Airways and currently has code-
share agreements with 15 other international
airlines, as well as strategic partnerships with
West African ASKY airlines and Malawi Airlines,
as part of its plan to create multiple hubs in
the region.
Ethiopian Airlines has grown rapidly over the last
ten years and provides a valuable underpinning
to the expansion of Ethiopian international
trade and relations, acting as a catalyst to
Addis Ababas emergence as a regional and even
global hub. As well as services to 17 domestic
destinations, the airline now offers flights to
80 international destinations, the most recent
addition being Shanghai.
Since 2003, the number of passengers has
quadrupled, increasing from 1.12m to 4.64m.
Cargo has grown even more, reaching
181,000 tonnes in 2012, up from just
36,000 tonnes in 2003. The fleet has been
modernised and has also increased from 29 a
decade ago to 62 by 2014. A further 33 aircraft -
including 8 Boeing Dreamliners - are on order.

Addis Ababa has emerged as a regional hub and
is home to key international organisations. The
African Union (AU), set up as a successor to the
Organisation of African Unity in 1999, has its
headquarters in Addis Ababa, which hosts the heads
of 54 member states at the annual summit, with
permanent staff residing in the Ethiopian capital
year-round. The new AU headquarters, a U5$200m
gift from the Chinese government inaugurated in
January 2012, dominates the skyline of the city
and serves as a reminder of Chinas expanding
influence on the African continent. It also serves
as a counterpoint to the headquarters of the
United Nations Economic Commission for Africa, set
up in 1961. Both organisations help to ensure that
Addis is firmly entrenched as a continental - and
international - meeting place.

Ethiopia's position in the troubled Horn of Africa
region gives it a particular strategic advantage with the
United States, which views it as a key ally. At the same
time, Chinese influence has strengthened over the
years, with increasing trade and extensive aid. Chinese
companies have invested in infrastructure projects but
also in light manufacturing, focusing on sectors that
are being prioritised by the Ethiopian government,
such as leather and textiles.
Ties with most of Ethiopias neighbours have
strengthened too, thanks to the countrys participation
in multilateral organisations such as the Amisom
peacekeeping mission in Somalia and the proposed
African Mechanism for Police Co operation i.
Crossborder infrastructure programmes have also
served to strengthen links. These include a water
pipeline to Djibouti as well as the implementation of
Ethiopia's hydropower potential, which will feed into a
regional power pool. But the dam-building programme
presents some challenges, particularly due to the
strain put on relations with Egypt given the challenge
to riparian rights to the Nile that is embodied in
the development of the Grand Renaissance Dam.
Relations with Eritrea remain at an impasse, but are
broadly stable.
18
The significant gains that Ethiopia has made over
the last fifteen years - in terms of macroeconomic
stability, growth, the development of hard and
soft infrastructure, reducing poverty and improving
the quality of life of ordinary Ethiopians - have
contributed to creating the enabling environment that
business - whether domestically-owned or foreign -
needs to thrive and prosper. This environment is still a
work in progress, and the investments planned in the
framework of the current Growth and Transformation
Plan (2010/11-2014/15) are designed to stimulate
further success, while in many cases they embody
business opportunities.
Meanwhile, investors from a wide range of countries
have already set up operations spanning a variety
of sectors. Some of these investments have already
changed the structure of Ethiopian exports; others will
gradually change the very structure of the economy, as
the manufacturing sector matures.
Ethiopia's growth miracle has been less a
miracle than the result of persistence and dogged
determination to address poverty in measurable
and meaningful ways: by creating the hard and
soft infrastructure that will enable business success,
by playing better to the countrys comparative
advantages in trade, and by ensuring both political
and macroeconomic stability. In short, the factors
underlying Ethiopia's stellar growth record have
been simple, but setting them in place represents an
extraordinary achievement.
