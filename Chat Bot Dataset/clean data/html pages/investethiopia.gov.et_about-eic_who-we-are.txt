Invest In EthiopiaGateway to attractive FDI opportunitiesFor nearly 30 years, the Ethiopian Investment Commission (EIC), an autonomous government institution with the mandate of investment promotion and regulation, has serviced over 5,000 foreign direct investments in the country.

Since its establishment in 1994, the EIC has been an active, dedicated and specialized promoter of Ethiopia and its strategic investment opportunities in Ethiopia. As such, it has responded quickly to the needs of both new and existing investors. Working under the Ethiopian Investment Board (which is chaired by the Prime Minister of Ethiopia), the EIC has been at the forefront of creating a conducive investment environment for FDIs.

Our active support for the improvement of the country’s business environment and our commitment to an ambitious reform agenda have helped make Ethiopia one of the top five investment destinations in Africa, and the top in East Africa. In 2021, we were able to attract over $4.1 billion in FDI in various priority sectors including agriculture, manufacturing, mining, tourism and hospitality.

In 2021, the EIC was awarded the Gold Award of the WAIPA-World Bank’s ‘Strengthening IPA Advocacy Services’ global competition for its relentless endeavor to reform the investment regime in the country. The EIC had previously received the 2018 AIM Investment Award, the 2017 United Nations Award, and the Global ‘Star Reformer’ Award from the World Bank Group in 2017 for its continued outstanding performance in investment promotion, FDI attraction and advocacy work.Forward-looking and Service-driven
