foreign direct investment with the target to create jobs and promote export as an integral part of the and growth and transformation plan gap iike As in other countries that have undergone a fast industrialisation process the development of the manufacturing industry in the country is facing a series of challenges among them the need to develop a skilled highly motivated workforce that leads to high productivity rates Most of these challenges are the natural consequence of a rapid introduction of manufacturing to a traditionally agricultural economy however the HR management practices of factories play a big role in facilitating this transition These guidelines have been commissioned by the Ethiopian Investment Commission and Enterprise Partners to red Group and Sustainability Agents susan gosh to help factories in Ethiopian industrial parks deal with their most pressing HR challenges effectively The guidelines are based on the Ethiopian labour proclamation international best practices and provides contextual recommendations for the management of the workforce Factories are encouraged and guided to develop effective HR structures and policies in order to Achieve high levels of retention motivation and productivity Comply with country laws and industry standards eo Prevent conflict absenteeism and tardiness Enhance competitiveness and meet the expectations of international clients Create a positive image of the factories and IPs among the community The HR Guidelines include legal requirements international standards instructions and recommendations developed for key areas of the HR function including Developing and enforcing of an HR manual that establishes a uniform system to manage all HR matters Setting up a fair transparent ethical and effective recruitment and selection practice that allows to find and hire the best candidates aligned to production needs Establishing a complete boarding programme that properly integrates employees to their new role and work environment sets up clear expectations and responsibilities and in cases of new hires from rural areas also helps them transition to their new living conditions Settling a comprehensive training program for all staff that allows the appropriate development of the workforce in both technical and soft skills Creating a culture that helps factories to align employees and resources with their strategic objectives Setting up adequate and competitive compensation schemes including wages allowances bonuses and other benefits taking a holistic approach to provide benefits that considers workers living conditions and contributes to boost productivity Developing effective legitimate transparent and safe grievance handling procedures to address employee concerns before they lead to more serious employee relations issues Creating and enforcing a clear transparent fair and well communicated disciplinary procedure in the factory that guides supervisors and managers in the discipline of employees promoting certainty and consistency in dealing with misconduct Setting up strategies for internal and external communication to disseminate the right information to all stakeholders including employees governments clients and the overall community in which the IP is set As most of the challenges the factories face are often shared by all factories in the industrial park a joint effort of tackling these challenges needs to be driven Through centralized social services factories and stakeholders can be able to find an optimum way of delivering services whereby worker satisfaction and community engagement is maintained with lower cost and energy Centralised social services and resources help the factories by Increasing of social services as joint efforts allow to provide better quality services with lesser resources Providing a level platform of minimum social services and standards thereby helping to avoid multiple and dispatching standards in industrial parks Preventing social and labour standards from being entangled into the logic of competition by restraining the use of different levels of social services between the factories to poach workers Contributing to fostering social peace with the communities around the park as sharing a joint strategy to manage community relationships contributes to protecting the reputation of the IP and of each factory Preventing unrest with the workforce as they receive standard social services that improve their living conditions Enabling the factories to focus on their core business production and quality as common needs and risks are addressed in a coordinated and effective manner which helps to significantly reduce the time and resources that each factory would require to do so individually With common understanding among all stakeholders and an efficient monitoring and evaluation system in place services that can be centralized at a park level include transport medical services meals subsidized shops training counselling community engagement and stakeholders management Centralized services bring benefits that exceed those achieved by factories working separately It is therefore highly encouraged that factories share knowledge and jointly address common needs work together towards joint solutions and develop new ways of offering better services to their workers while saving costs The better the whole IP performs the more competitive advantage it will have in attracting and retaining workforce and clients HUMAN RESOURCE GUIDELINES Introduction Introduction 1. Industrialisation in Ethiopia Ethiopia is moving fast towards industrialisation As part of its development strategy the Ethiopian government has actively promoted the development of industries by implementing sector development plans offering incentive schemes to foreign investors and financing industrial parks across the country This has made Ethiopia an attractive country for different industries and in particular apparel companies who face constant pressure to keep up with competitive pricing worldwide ethiopians industrialisation however has not come without its challenges As in almost every other country that has undergone a fast industrialisation process the development of the manufacturing industry in Ethiopia is facing a series of challenges among them the need to develop a skilled highly motivated workforce that leads to high productivity rates Most of these challenges are the natural consequence of a rapid introduction of manufacturing to a traditionally agricultural economy however the HR management practices of factories play a big role in facilitating this transition The implementation of policies and procedures that are comprehensive enough and adapted to the local culture and applicable legislation the adequate enforcement of the policies and procedures in place the presence of a longterm vision and practices for the training and development of the workforce and a good documentation and evaluation of practices among others can contribute to the development of working environments therefore it has become increasingly clear that the role of HR in the process of industrialisation is of utmost importance 2. Working conditions in the factory According to the International Labour Organization working conditions are at the core of paid work and employment relationships They include a wide range of topics and issues including working time remuneration physical conditions and mental demands that exist in the workplace and therefore can have a great impact on the wellbeing of employees In the area of workers health for example not taking adequate measures to minimise the impact of occupational risks such as injuries noise carcinogenic agents airborne particles and ergonomic risks can lead to chronic health problems in workers According to the World Health organization occupational risks account for of all cases of back pain of hearing loss and of chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases among others Good working conditions are therefore important for ensuring the wellbeing of workers companies however also profit from good labour practices Studies by the lot show that factories experience great improvements in productivity when workers feel satisfied with the infrastructure services provided by factories canteen restrooms health services and relationship 1 ill Research brief Working conditions Productivity and Profitability Evidence from Better Work vietnam with their employer moreover the studies also found that these factories have a better position in the supply chain and are likely to be the preferred supplier to their most important clients HR has a central role in guaranteeing that the working conditions at the factory lead to not only a working environment that maximise human capital and the profitability of the factories but also to a satisfied workforce 3. The role of Human Resources HR has an important and strategic role in industries They are responsible for managing people as well as business resources They are involved not only in managing the most important component of a successful factory the workforce but also in managing tasks related to compliance stakeholders management general administration and safety Human resources departments can create value in factories in many different ways such as developing and enforcing policies and procedures aligned with international standards and national laws enhancing communication in the factory acquiring developing and retaining talent creating a culture and ensuring a highly compliant and motivating working environment however due to the fast pace and high pressure in manufacturing industries HR departments of factories are often diverted from their main role and responsibilities as business partners of the company and tend to focus on dealing with transactional issues and managing crises This document aims to provide some guidelines to help HR departments in the Ethiopian manufacturing industry to successfully localised and implement effective HR solutions and thereby tackle some of the most pressing issues that they can face These guidelines are based on the Ethiopian Labour proclamation and its A amendments In cases of revisions of enactment of a new labour proclamation factories must align the guidelines with the new provisions 4. Human Resources Guidelines Enterprise Partners to red Group and Sustainability Agents susan As mentioned above the guidelines are meant to help factories in industrial parks in Ethiopia to deal with their most pressing HR challenges effectively The guidelines are based on an assessment of the main issues affecting production performance and worker satisfaction in factories that have either already started or are preparing to start production They present HR management solutions adapted to the labour proclamation the local culture and international standards The focus of the guidelines is on solving practical issues in a comprehensive realistic culturally adapted and way The guidelines are divided into the following sections Chapter The HR policy Manual Chapter Recruitment and selection Chapter Compensation Chapter Leave management Chapter Grievance procedure Chapter Employee Movement promotion demotion Termination Chapter The way forwards Annex Centralized Services in Industrial Parks Useful tools are provided in each chapter to help factories address challenges effectively The final chapter of the guideline includes a checklist to monitor the implementation of the recommendations provided and an HR Scorecard template with suggested kris to track the performance of the HR departments The guideline also incorporates suggestions for factories in Industrial Park to work centralizing services that would allow them to reduce costs and increase the impact of their initiatives This information can be found in Annex 1. Regardless of what stage of HR development a factory is in there is always a way to improve HR processes and boost productivity and wellbeing in a factory The guideline hopes therefore not only to provide specific ideas to be applied and adapted to factories but also to inspire them to start taking action Starting is the hardest part but as the saying goes the start is half the battle HUMAN RESOURCE GUIDELINES Chapter The HR policy manual Chapter The HR policy manual 1. The importance of an HR manual The HR policy and procedure manual ihr manual is a vital document that establishes a uniform system to manage all HR matters detailing policies and procedures regarding employee management and the relationship between managers and employees Its development and application allow organizations to meet basic legal obligations make consistent and reliable decisions based on the company values and legal requirements establish a clear understanding of expectations rules and consequences reduce the chances of making mistakes and creating misunderstandings make the system more transparent and easier to work in attracting more business and more employees introduce employees to the business and their new job The HR manual brings sustainable longterm benefits since it will decrease arbitrary handling of personnel matters helping to reduce disputes or grievances Developing and improving an HR manual if factories already have one is also Consider the amount of time employees spend asking questions about their rights and the existing practices policies and procedures and how much time their supervisors managers spend finding answers and solutions to those queries This can be especially challenging in factories with employees from different nationalities who speak different languages andlor have different cultural backgrounds An HR manual contains all the necessary information on employee management allows employees to become aware of their rights and obligations and reduces misunderstandings due to poorly defined working conditions however the mere existence of an HR manual is not in itself a guarantee of good HR management Some common mistakes made by factories include an HR manual consisting of a compilation of policies without internal coherence or policies that are only developed for auditing purposes to simply adopt HR manuals from other companies or countries to simply have an HR manual on paper without proper enforcement This chapter provides the guidelines to be followed to develop or review HR manuals in ethiopians ipso 2. HR policy and procedures the essentials The HR manual includes all the policies and procedures relevant to the management of the workforce This section outlines the minimum content that should be present in an HR manual for Ethiopian ipso The HR manual should introduce key information about the company its objectives and values and the purpose of the manual All policies and procedures should be aligned with what is presented in this chapter which sets ups up the basis for all the HR manual Information and rules on the daily work and the usage of the working space should be clear to all employees including  working time work areas security dress code phone usage bathrooms and canteens waste bins etc The HR manual should include the policies and regulations related to ethical principles and compliance These may include  obligations of the employer and employees was stated in the Labour law organizations code of conduct equal employment opportunity anti corruption conflict of interest and all policies and regulations that relate to this topic The factories must have clear guidance on the strategy to attract and select staff that meets the requirements of production For more information refer to Chapter 2 of these guidelines A comprehensive boarding process is crucial to properly introduce workers to their new role and work environment help them transition to their new living conditions and thereby promote retention and workplace satisfaction The policy registers all steps that managers and staff must follow during this process For more information refer to Chapter 3 of these guidelines All factories must provide formal training to their employees for them to be able to perform at their positions effectively and safely There are multiple benefits in developing and enforcing ambitious training programs such as improvements in productivity workforce satisfaction and retention The policy and procedures on training and career development should be included in the HR manual For more information refer to Chapter 4 of these guidelines To develop a working culture based on performance the first step is to set up the performance management mechanisms that will enable it For more information refer to Chapter 5 of these guidelines All employees of the factory should have a clear understanding about their salary composition and its calculations The policy should include the calculation of employees wages according to clear scales that ensure transparency and fairness information on pay dates overtime payroll deductions etc as well as all benefits such as insurance allowances and unkind contributions For more information refer to Chapter 6 of these guidelines The different types of leave an employee can request and the procedures that must be followed to do so should be clearly stated in the HR manual including paid annual leave sick leave maternity leave and special leaves such as marriage compassionate leave union leaves etc and unpaid leave For more information refer to Chapter 7 of these guidelines HR departments should establish clear simple and structured procedures that ensures the detection solution and communication of grievances in the factory These procedures must guarantee that employees are protected when sounding the alarm or expressing dissatisfaction and that grievances reported will be handled appropriately For more information refer to Chapter 8 of these guidelines A clear and procedure that defines the disciplinary and corrective actions in cases of employee misconduct must be developed to encourage work ethic and discipline A disciplinary procedure helps to prevent conflicts and misunderstandings and needs to be properly enforced at all levels without exceptions For more information refer to Chapter 9 of The HR manual should clearly state the procedures for all movement of staff including promotion demotion transfer and termination For more information refer to Chapter 10 of The HR manual shall detail the Health and Safety Management System in place to provide and maintain a safe working environment for employee This includes the evaluation of safety hazards the provision of protective equipment and the delivery of training along with any measures necessary to prevent andlor correct conditions that endanger workers health safety and the environment The HR Department is responsible for keeping all employee data The HR manual shall include all procedures that guarantee that any and all information that to an employees employment status including promotions transfers absenteeism training performance appraisals letters of discipline leave etc will be placed in their personal file that the information is accurate that employees have access to their information and that the files will be kept safe 14 A Whereas other policies can be included depending on the needs of each organization it is important to keep the focus on the policies that matter to the factories and the ip Length does not equal quality 3. Writing the HR Manual Structure of policies and procedures When it comes to writing the HR manual it is important that the content of all policies follows the same structure such as Policy name Version number effective date and approving authorities Purpose of the policy what it is intended to promote or achieve Main policy statement Definitions of any key concepts or terms used in the policy Eligibility or scope what groups of employees are covered by the policy Procedure if applicable numbered instructions for carrying out the policy Scope of permissible exceptions and who is responsible for making exceptions to the general application of the policy if applicable Positions in the organization responsible for implementing and monitoring the policy Forms if any Style and language An HR manual should be written in a clear and consistent way maintaining an overall coherence and leaving some flexibility to adapt to new conditions Keep it simple and concise The HR manual should be prepared objectively and comprehensively so that all the policies have consistency and share the same standards It is very important to keep the document free from excessive complexity or overlap to avoid confusion Be consistent with your language Terms should be used consistently even when there are multiple terms for the same process Using synonyms such as payment or remuneration interchangeable can lead to confusion languages The HR manual in Ethiopian IPs must be available in alaric and the most widely used language regionally It is also useful for the factories to have their manuals in english as HR manuals are usually a requirement from clients Legal aspects The HR Manual is a guide and not a contract with the employees Although it guides HR interactions in the factories it should not tie the hands of the HR department Please follow the next steps to ensure you comply with legal matters that your HR manual facilitates rather than impedes HR processes and to avert misunderstandings that could create legal problems Legal compliance Before approval by either the HR manager company CEO or board all policies and procedures must be reviewed to ensure compliance with the applicable legislation and should be consistent with the terms of any collective agreements Legal experts should be involved at this stage Leave room for flexibility Although the policies should be comprehensive and leave no room for confusion they should also leave room for managers to flexible respond to individual situations The manual should be more a set of guidelines rather than a strict book of rules especially as everyone will be expected to act in full compliance with the manual Be realistic A way to avoid ending up with an HR manual that is too prohibitive is to make sure that its policies are pragmatic reasonable and adapted to the organization disclaimer It is useful to include disclaimer that clearly state the scope and limits of the HR manual and guarantee a certain level of flexibility for the management such as  Limits of the HR manual The policies in this HR manual do not constitute a contract with any employee supervisor or manager or a contract guaranteeing any benefits or agreeing to maintain any procedures or policies contained  Validity of policies The policies in this manual supersede any previous policies published on the matters they treat  Right to make changes The company reserves the unlimited right to change or revise the content of the manual at any time and in any lawful manner without prior notice 4. Communicating the HR Policies and Procedures Once the HR manual is ready it is time to communicate its policies and procedures with all employees of the factory There are several ways to do so Training Training on the policies and procedures should be a part of the boarding process Training is an opportunity to discuss the policies with employees clarify questions and give examples The HR department should be the first to be trained in all policies and procedures and have a good understanding of the labour law Every staff member of the HR department should master the HR manual The HR manager should have the mandate to ensure that all the staff from hearthis department has an excellent knowledge of the manual This knowledge should be provided during the boarding period of the HR staff The management sets the expectations and commitments to workplace practices They must have a good knowledge of the policies and procedures in particular those relevant to their scope and responsibilities The middle managers supervisors should be trained exhaustively on the policies and procedures as they are directly responsible for the operators This knowledge needs to be accompanied with enforcement strategies Operators need to be trained on the factory policies what is expected from them and what they can expect from the factory This usually takes place during the period The Employee Handbook The employee handbook is a summary of the HR manual that includes policies and procedures that are most relevant for the employees While the HR manual is a reference tool for managers and supervisors the handbook is written with employees as the intended audience The written communication of the policies allows the factory to document that the employee was informed about the rules and that the expectations of them are clear In factories as many workers have low educational levels it should be particularly simple and straightforward Including illustrate pictures and graphics is highly recommended The Employee handbooks of factories in Ethiopia IPs must include The factorys history mission vision and goals The factorys core values and culture The factorys policies related to General employment policies and practices Business ethics such as and policy Discipline policy Health and safety policy Compensation policy Employee benefits policy Work conditions and hours Attendance and leave of absence policy Work performance Employee benefits additionally considering the novelty of IPs in Ethiopia and the percentage of workers who arrive from other areas the Employee Handbook should also include helpful information to facilitate integration to the industry and the city and to highlight their role in the country industrialization and development process 1. The Industry Basic information about the industry Industrialization in Ethiopia benefits role of workers in the country strategy 2. The Industrial Park Basic information about the park centralized Services 3. city services and public organizations police city council health centres etc 5. review HR manual as a living document The HR policies must reflect changes in legislation and the environment therefore it is important that they are periodically revisited and updated to preserve their legality relevance and efficiency Review triggers A review of the HR manual can be triggered for different reasons including A scheduled review It is recommended that HR policies and procedures are reviewed periodically every two years to evaluate their pertinent in the company their compliance to new laws and requirements from clients and their performance A suggestion from a competent source Many times internal or external stakeholders may suggest improvements to the existing policies These suggestions should be evaluated and if considered useful integrated in the policies An identified problem or issue When an issue with the policy or procedures identified the review process must be done immediately to correct it A change in legislation Changes in labour legislation will most certainly affect the HR manual which will need to be reviewed to integrate them In these cases a legal advisor should be consulted to make sure all revisions reflect the legal changes Reviewing the HR manual does not necessarily mean that it has to be modified instead itis also a way to ensure that the current practices are aligned with what is written in the manual Types of changes The HR manual might need to incorporate minor changes or major structural changes Adding clarification to terms or statements Add a small section to a policy or a complementary Minor changes procedure  Correct small mistakes Modifying established procedures or processes Changes in the scope or objectives of the policy Major changes Changes that relate to new legislation Correct a serious inconsistency Rewrite an entire policy The review processes Revisions responsible An HR employee should be assigned as the responsible person for HR manual revisions ihr manager coordinator or another relevant staff member This person will be in charge of revisions and deciding the type of changes needed Review committee A committee composed of experts on the company policy including HR personnel general counsels or members of the board will be formed for the HR manual review along with workers representatives They will be in charge of assessing the policies on the basis of their effectiveness completeness consistency clarity and legality They will draft a revised policy and send for approval to the executive Steps for periodic revisions and major changes  The person responsible for revisions will set up a date for the review Previous to the date shelve will send to the review committee this can include a draft of the new policy The committee will meet on the designated day and decide on the revisions A legal adviser can be contacted to review the documents The new policy is sent for approval to upper management The revision of the policy is announced to employees and stakeholders If necessary training will be delivered oO 0 Oo Steps for reviewing minor changes  The person responsible for revisions decides on changes to be incorporated if any  herthe prepares a draft with the minor changes  The draft is submitted for approval to the upper management Make sure employees receive all significant updates to policies 6. Daily communication and implementation of the policies Disseminating the policies and procedures of the HR manual is not limited to training it is a continuous process that needs to be taken care off to help ensure that violations and incidents are kept to a minimum But not only sharing the information is important the policies need to be enforced in every level of the company at all times Be sure to follow all the policies and procedures outlined in the manual Not following policies even when it is done to help employees creates confusion and leads to an increase of violations Establish open communication to allow employees to ask questions Employees should be encouraged to ask their immediate supervisor about particular information on the policies and how they apply to the individual employee If there is any grievance related to the HR policies or the communication of the policies this can be raised through the different grievance procedures Use coaching and progressive discipline to reinforce policies Reminders should be sent periodically to all employees outlining certain policies or aspects of a policy that could be misunderstood or omitted in daily work The HR manual and all its policies should be enforced as soon as they are introduced Employees need to be aware of the fact that breaching rules will result in disciplinary actions HUMAN RESOURCE GUIDELINES Chapter Recruitment and selection Recruitment and selection are part of the basic HR functions and have a great influence on the success of all other HR activities Recruitment refers to the process of searching for candidates andlor persuading them to apply for jobs in the organisation while selection is the process of screening the candidates and choosing the most suitable applicants for vacant positions Developing a fair transparent ethical and effective recruitment and selection practice is important because Factories depend on a consistent supply of employees to deliver their commitments to customers on time it reduces the time and cost of replacement of ineffective hires It leads to attracting and hiring employees that are capable and willing to perform in their functions which reduces training time and cost It is one of the earliest interactions between employees and factories which has a determining effect on their perception of them and their future work Positive recruitment and selection experiences of workers lead to a good reputation in the community which in turn makes future recruitment easier It paves the way to avoid future disputes with regard to unfair treatment discrimination and grievances Future recruitment and selection efforts become more refined as learning are applied and necessary modifications are made Equal Employment Opportunity In the process of recruitment and selection factories must provide equal employment opportunity to everyone regardless of gender ethnicity race national origin religion marital status political belief or disability that does not prohibit performance of essential job functions All vacancies should be filled with qualified applicants based on merit against set standards and qualifications who have gone through a fair objective and selection process Establishing an efficient recruitment and selection strategy and process that meets the factories business strategy and goals is therefore a stepping stone in maximising human capital in the factories In order to ensure that the process is fair transparent and ethical it should needless to say comply with the applicable labour regulations and international conventions In the following sections the chapter describes the steps that are typically found in the recruitment and selection process All of these steps have to be followed thoroughly in order to ensure that the process will have the desired results finding the right candidates for each position 1. Planning The first step in the recruitment and selection process is planning This will guarantee that 20 The right vacancies are identified The staff hired matches the objectives and targets of the factory based on the job description of the position and The recruitment is adequate to address any shortage of employees and does not lead to hiring an excessive number of employees that end up being idle Job Descriptions A job description is a basic document that specifies the role and responsibilities of each employee of the factory It specifies the key results areas required and how the employee is expected to behave It includes Position title Position summary overall role description Reporting relationship Key roles and responsibilities Developing job descriptions is important as it provides the first impression to the candidates and gives them a clear idea of the skills necessary to apply and the duties they will be expected to perform Unclear descriptions can later create job dissatisfaction as employees are usually unhappy when they have to perform duties that they were not originally hired to perform This unhappiness in turn can lead to lower retention and higher turnover rates especially among new hires Planning is usually a task assigned to production managers and HR departments mainly receive their requests however a more active role from the HR in the form of providing guidance optimizing communication and feedback can help to improve the recruitment process In particular trends in absenteeism and leave need to be shared by the HR with the respective departments so that they consider it in the process of planning This can greatly contribute to crafting a more realistic plan to meet the production targets as well as to accurately identify skills and knowledge needed to fill in the positions 2. Developing a Strategy Once the requirements of production planning are received it is time to develop a strategy for finding selecting and hiring the best candidates for each position Having a strategy developed before randomly starting the process is a way of keeping control of the whole process This means that it will help to ensure that all the necessary steps are defined and followed the responsible people will be defined and everything will be done in compliance with the labour law 3. Sourcing Sourcing is the activity of determining which are the suitable candidates for a vacant position and how to find them Factories make their sourcing decisions based on production plans existing workforce numbers and anticipated changes in the short to medium terms 21 Sourcing is the first step in the recruitment and selection process and it is very important because the availability of an adequate and qualified pool of applicants determines the success of subsequent recruitment activities The sourcing stage starts when the line manager of the vacant position submits to HR a Staff Requisition form a template for this form can be found in Annex of this chapter Sourcing of a suitable pool of candidates may include using the following methods Internal Vacancy announcement Through notice board announcement or email for upper positions detail procedures for hiring internal and extra al candidates are presented in Annex Il of this chapter External Vacancy announcement Through traditional media print radio based job boards or relevant social media Employee Referral program Recommendations from existing or past employees Employment agency Through a contract signed with agencies who strictly adhere to applicable laws with regard to equal opportunity labour proclamation and employment exchange services Catchment areas The regional authorities can be involved in the initial sourcing and basic screening of candidates in catchment areas to supply qualified candidates to companies Career Centres in Higher Education institutions Through universities colleges and technical and vocational education training centres programs walkin applications Unsolicited applications from walkin candidates Working with External Parties If the factory chooses to work with external parties it should keep a strict control on their activities to avoid the risk of corruption in the recruitment practices and prevent the exploitation of workers Bad practices include Giving false information to workers regarding working conditions and compensation Making false promises or selling a job interview or a position to workers in exchange of money or sexual favours Regardless of the methods used to source candidates it is important that candidates submit a complete application that contains the basic information below to avoid back and forth communication with candidates The next step of initial screening also becomes effective only if the information is properly captured It is important to clearly communicate to workers of all the documentation needed before they arrive to the factory and clarify that the application form will be ready for them to fill in when they arrive to the factory Factories have to ensure that the application form is prepared beforehand so that it is ready when the candidate visits the factory 22 Basic Information in an Application Full Name of the Candidate contact Details ad Card Number Address Educational qualifications with supporting documents Experience with supporting documents if applicable TIN card if available Pension card if available 4. Screening Once an adequate number of candidates are identified the HR department can complete initial screening based on the minimum criteria specified in the Staff Requisition form This step of initial screen ing enables factories to exclude those applicants who are not eligible for hire and proceed with only those who merit further screening thereby reducing the cost of unsuitable selections in terms of time and effort Applicants should satisfy the required qualification and experience in order to be eligible for employment Factories should develop their own standards for recruiting including age The minimum age for hazardous work in Ethiopia is set as 78 years Workers between the ages of 74 to 18 years are classified as young workers The age of workers might be part of the factory Code of Conduct and a special treatment for young workers is usually a requirement of brands and international certifications It is highly recommended that all employees hired are more than 18 years old Minimum Age for Employment the ill convention on minimum age sets the general minimum age for admission to employment or work at 15 years for light work and the minimum age for hazardous work at 18 under certain strict conditions Address of the candidate The address of the candidate becomes relevant only for enhancing understanding of what affects retention and turnover rates and also the needs of employees Employees who live far away from the factory might have difficulty commuting to work which may impact their levels of tardiness absenteeism and fatigue They may also experience difficulties when required to do overtime work due to lack of available transport to go back home at late hours finally when the options for transport are limited and commutes are long and exhausting in the longterm they may show lower performance and ultimately may also be more likely to quit their jobs therefore it is necessary that the HR takes this factor into account only to take necessary measures to address issues faced by the employees and never to discriminate potential candidates Considering the address of the candidates should never be used as a basis for discriminating potential employees of different ethical background HR Managers should 23 monitor that the principle of equal employment opportunity is being applied at all times during the recruitment process capacities Certain positions might require that specific physical capabilities are met by candidates bona fide occupational qualification requirements In such cases employers are allowed to consider these capabilities while making decisions about hiring employees For example if a candidate with colour blindness applies to a job in a dyeing factory that required the candidate to differentiate between colours herthe may be excluded from the next steps in the application process as the ability to distinguish colour is a core necessary capability for the position Shortlisted candidates from this step would be invited to continue with the next steps of the recruitment process the selection test 5. Selection Once a shortlist of candidates is identified factories perform selection tests for a particular position The selection tests may range from written test work sample test interviews or a combination of them The selection test is the final step before formalities It determines who will be hired who will be on for next time and who will be excluded from the employment decision The topics on which the candidate will be evaluated depend on the job description and will include technical and behavioural aspects No matter what the position is certain aspects should be evaluated in all candidates that will work in a factory including motivation If a candidate is not motivated to work in the factory to start with the possibility that they will quit soon is very likely In order to get an idea of what the level of motivation is HR can consider asking about the source of information about the job we go how did the candidate get to know about this position and expectations towards living conditions we go why has herthe decided to apply what appeals to higher about the job what change do they expect to see in their lives after joining the factory etc Future plans An effort has to be made to discover what the plans of the candidate are Is herthe hoping to make a career in manufacturing Or is herthe just looking for a temporary summer job and then plans to return to school Time management Time is crucial in manufacturing and new employees will have to adapt to very strict times and demonstrate a will to do so including working in shifts Useful questions might include How do you organise your work tasks how do you decide what you will do first What do you do when you know you will not be able to complete a task on time Working in demanding environments Candidates should be aware and understand the high demands of this type of job qualifications Candidates who are overqualified are more likely to leave the position soon and are more likely to have a difficult time adapting to the factory requirements The weight given to a particular test in conjunction with document review should be agreed beforehand between the HR department and the recruiting requesting department 24 6. Communication Once the selection is made an offer with all relevant details should be given to the candidates Good communication with all involved parties including candidates agencies requesting departments and other relevant in a professional way is one of the bases of the image of the factory and the industrial park in the community Candidates have to inform the factory if the offer is accepted or not within an established period of time that also has to be clearly communicated to the recommended to keep this time between three candidate It is to five working days after receiving the offer letter to facilitate decision making Candidates who were not successful should also be notified about their results and if necessary with a brief explanation as to why they have not been considered for the job For those who met the established criteria but were not selected the factory should consider them for future recruitment processes to apply again in the future potential candidates in the future Importance of Communication with Candidates in the Recruitment Process All applicants that have been rejected in any step of the recruitment process should receive a notice from the factory explaining even if only briefly the main reasons why they have not been considered for the position If relevant the note should also encourage the applicant Applicants dismissed without any further explanations in particular when new to the labour market may end up with a negative image of the factory and the IP in general This can hurt the reputation of the factory and IP in the community which can later limit the pool of 7. Documentation Upon successful completion of the recruitment process a personnel file of the new employee should be created The file should include the following documents Optional only when applicable  Staff Requisition Form  Minutes of the selection committee  Application Form  Personal Details Form  Education and Experience testimonials  Identification Card  Tax Identification card  Pension card if available  Offer Letter Job description Resume commitment we go agreement from company to cover travel costs of candidates etc  Results of medical tests if performed we go colour blindness test etc  Official we go driving license  Feedback from previous employer 25 8. After recruiting Retention Once the new employees starts to work in the factory the challenge continues the HR department has to focus efforts in retaining all the workforce that brings value to the organisation Retention is a continuing process in the relationship with the employee It never stops Failing to retain employees costs Employee turnover is one of the major problems that factories face understanding preventing and tackling turnover requires an efficient all the time and resources invested in recruiting hiring on and comprehensive approach and boarding and training them retention strategies Some strategies for retention include Delivering an boarding training that covers all the necessary topics for new employees in order to enable them to perform in their new positions This involves assigning enough time to the boarding process and considering not only the technical aspects of the job but all the soft skills that will facilitate good performance Providing continuous training to all employees for them to acquire new skills be able to increase their performance and feel motivated and capable of building a career in the factory Establishing a culture that rewards good performance and helps to improve the performance of those who are having difficulties in reaching their targets Involving the employee in setting up their objectives understanding their capabilities and making plans to improve their performance This will help to generate ownership responsibility and a sense of belonging Offering competitive salaries and benefits that guarantee at the very minimum the physical subsistence of workers and their families A salary that is not enough to have access to food housing transport and the basic needs for a decent living standard will not help retain employees Encouraging top performers to develop a career in the factory assigning responsibilities and promoting them to higher positions with the required training to increase their knowledge and develop new skills Promotion procedures have to be fair and transparent Creating a working environment that promotes communication between all levels sets up clear rules for behaviour in the factory and applies them consistently without differentiating among employees The next chapters of this HR Guideline are meant to help all factories in Ethiopian industrial parks to develop a working environment that boosts worker satisfaction and happiness and improves retention 26 Annex Staff Requisition Form  New Position  Budgeted and Approved Replacement for a Vacancy  Temporary Cover from to insert dates 1. education 2. experience 3.

The benefits of boarding boarding is the process of integrating new employees into the organisation by providing them with tools knowledge skills and attitudes that are necessary to perform their role effectively achieve job satisfaction and understand the culture of the factory Since industrialisation is relatively new in Ethiopia and most of the population comes from rural areas many workers need to be introduced to the industrial work culture and to an urban lifestyle Against this background a comprehensive boarding process is crucial to properly integrate workers to their new role and work environment help them transition to their new living conditions and thereby promote retention and workplace satisfaction An effective boarding training programme has numerous benefits for the employees and the organisation including It ensures understanding and compliance with the factorys vision mission philosophy and objectives It assists employees in understanding the factorys culture values attitudes accepted norms of behaviour and structure rules and processes in relation to working hours code of conduct and disciplinary procedures overtime policy leave policy grievances handling career and growth opportunities and performance evaluation among others It builds awareness not only regarding benefits offered to employees by the factory but also about their roles and responsibilities This helps employees understand what the factorys expectations are and what the employee receives in return It helps to develop the needed attitude skill sets and competence to fulfil the role It contributes to developing a sense of trust between the new employee and the factory and helps the employee to feel more comfortable with the new environment It helps to increase employee engagement motivation and retention which also translates into less attrition and turnover of employees It accelerates the employees process to becoming contributing members that add value to the factory Most of the employees make the decision of whether to stay or not in the factory within their first months of work A good boarding process that enables workers to feel confident about their new skills that helps them understand the needs of the industry and their role in the factory and that introduces them to the factory culture structure and internal sources of support in cases of doubts or concerns is a must if factories want to improve retention rates Needless to say this is not only applicable to operators and supervisors but managers and middle managers as well They also have to be properly boarded to their roles and responsibilities and provided with the basic skills that they will require to confidently fulfil their tasks 32 Despite the importance of lack of planning sometimes leads to trainings that are conducted in a rush without considering all relevant topics nor adequate methods for ensuring that the content is understood by the employees To help HR departments in ethiopians IPs with the task of providing effective this chapter provides a basis for designing and planning a comprehensive and impactful boarding programmed As the technical skills will vary from industry to industry both in content and length the guidelines in the next sections focus on basic standards to be applied to all other training topics such as soft skills company culture finally it should be noted that training does not end with the boarding sessions The of the workforce is a continuous process that promotes improvements in workers performance and their career development in the factory As this chapter is focused on ongoing training and development are covered in a separate chapter Chapter Training and development 2. The boarding plan Target audience New employees boarding new employees should be done as soon as they start to work in the factory with a clear schedule and comprehensive agenda for all employees The boarding should take a minimum of 3 days and up to one week in order to make sure that all relevant topics are thoroughly covered and that a learning process has taken place The technical training of employees will usually take longer and it will depend on the specific industry and position Implementing a buddy system can be very helpful for newcomers to adapt to the new working environment faster It involves assigning an existing employee who guides the newcomer through the first few weeks or months on the job A common practice that should be avoided is to deliver boarding sessions randomly depending on production needs as the risk of losing coherence between training sessions not delivering all the content or rushing through the topics due to the lack of time is high It is necessary to keep in mind at all times that boarding training is key to retention and workplace satisfaction and depends on how comprehensive coherent and structured the training programme is In addition take into account that the introduction to employees to a company starts before the boarding training and ends sometime after it During the recruiting phase The receive information and based on this form impressions of the company Special care should be taken since the first contact with the employee making sure that they always receive clear and accurate information andlor instructions on all relevant topics After the boarding training Refresher trainings have to be provided regularly to strengthen and consolidate newly acquired knowledge These refresher trainings can be conducted by direct supervisors managers 33 Promoted employees boarding training should also be provided to employees that have been promoted and therefore start a new position in the factory Whenever an employee acquires new responsibilities it is necessary to train higher with the skills necessary to be able to perform in that position Failing to prepare the employee for the new position will not only affect higher performance level but also decrease the level of workplace satisfaction In case of workers promoted to supervisors itis particularly important to ensure that they go through an induction process that allows them to develop not only the new technical tasks that they will need but also the soft skills required to successfully manage their team Not planning a comprehensive boarding training to endow them with the necessary tools to succeed in their new position has negative effects in the production in team work and in the job satisfaction and morale of both the supervisors and the workers under their guidance boarding Content General content No matter the position in the factory there is general knowledge all employees need to learn An overview of topics that should be included is provided in the table below 34 The topics above should be covered for all employees and in addition supplementary sessions should be prepared and tailored to meet the needs of different positions operators middle management and management Specific content for operators Many operators who start working in IPs come from rural areas and are not yet familiar with the challenges and comforts of living in the city As most of them lack previous working experience in factories working in manufacturing is often also novel to them boarding must therefore include an introduction to new living conditions in order to avoid frustration and contribute to a smoother adaptation process Below is a recommendation of topics to be included in the boarding process of operators Specific content for the middle managers and managers The management and middle management level in particular new graduates that are to start a job in a manufacturing for the first time must also understand the functioning of factories their responsibilities and the skills that need to be developed to perform their work A particular issue that has been highlighted by operating factories in Ethiopian IPs is the lack of soft skills low motivation and unrealistic expectations of new graduates This challenge has to be tackled from the very beginning The boarding of these employees should therefore clearly state their responsibilities explain performance evaluation and clarify their career opportunities within the The boarding period is also a good moment to detect motivation dedication and skills that were possibly not observed in the recruiting period  Leadership and communication skills  Conflict management  skills 3. boarding delivery method Almost as important as the content of the boarding training is the training delivery method Below is a list of tips that will help you ensure the effectiveness of your training Participatory methods such as role plays action learning and storytelling should be used to improve not only the understanding and ownership of the knowledge but also the concentration level of participants and interest showed during the sessions A program with the schedule should be delivered to employees before they start the on boarding training for them to familiarize with the topics beforehand and to keep track of what they are learning This document should specify the name of the trainers and the timetable Key departments should be engaged in the preparation of the training and should select speakers to greet and brief the new starters on specific topics This helps participants to better know the factory and to feel that the company cares about them Handouts with the information on all the topics covered should be delivered to the employees These must be written in the regions main language The style of the handbook must be clean and simple easy for everyone to understand Pictures should be included when they allow a better understanding of a subject The boarding training should be included in the records of all participants This should include a checklist with all topics in which they have have not participated a template can be found in Annex of this chapter 4. boarding review As with every training the effectiveness of the boarding has to be evaluated After the boarding training seek feedback from all participants through a survey you can find a template in Annex Il of this chapter If new starters leave during or soon after completing the induction period an interview with them will give key information to improve not only the boarding but also the recruitment process Feedback of direct supervisors and managers can also collaborate to continuously improve the boarding plan 36 Annex boarding Checklist Template for new hires Employee

GUIDELINES Chapter Training and development 1. The benefits of training Efforts made to train and develop the workforce have proven to have numerous benefits In relation to productivity unskilled workers are more efficient and therefore produce not only greater quantities but also products in less time This improvement in efficiency and quality in turn ensures that production targets are reached faster pilot and boosts the factories competitiveness in the global market however the benefits of training are not limited to the area of productivity Training has also proven to have a positive impact on the stability of the workforce Trained and skilled workers tend to show more loyalty to factories They also feel more motivated to further develop themselves not only to earn better salaries and move to better positions but also to ultimately improve their living conditions This motivation often translates into lower turnover and absenteeism rates and higher rates as workers are enabled to earn higher salaries A good example of the positive effects that training has on productivity and the workforce in general is the case of the readymade garment industry in cambodian and indian Training programs in factories in these countries have resulted in the following impacts 2 More than efficiency improvement approve increase in the hourly payment unto increase in ratio unto reduction in absenteeism rates unto increase in retention rates 0 Lo More than 50 Jo reduction in worker turnover Spill over effects for who work closely with those who have been trained 2. The challenge of training With the expansion of manufacturing in ethiopian there has been a growing demand for skilled workers and managers The Ethiopian government has taken several initiatives to develop the country workforce and to equip them with the knowledge and abilities required to address this 2 hurt Nanda et all lot el at as cited in hearse skills Employment and Productivity in the Garments and Construction Sectors in and elsewhere Oxford Policy management 42 demand Many factories have tried to complement the governments efforts by training their own staff in the technical and soft skills that meet their specific needs The efforts made by the factories have however been met with limited success due to a number of reasons first even if HR departments are fully aware of the benefits of training they are often assigned scarce resources a low budget for this purpose second to exacerbate this problem time is often not allocated for workers and staff to be trained and tight production plans don t not take training into account finally although trainings take place in the factories they often lack a clearly defined structure As a results the lack of proper training leads to factories being caught in a vicious cycle low productivity and high turnover put more production pressure on the factory Due to higher production pressure and partly due to fear of investing in staff that might leave to other factories factories invest less resources we go time workers into training and development The lack of comprehensive training prevents the workforce from developing which leads to their inability to meet production targets this in turn contributes to their feeling stressed and frustrated which results in their losing motivation and consequently a decrease in performance And the lack of skills decrease in motivation and the dropping performance lead to turnover and low productivity drop in low productivity performance high turnover frustration high production motivation pressure less resources importance given to training inability to meet targets car unskilled workers How can factories avoid or get out of this vicious cycle Well planned quality training can help factories avoid falling into this trap and get out of it As shown previously with the appropriate structure and methods training can be an investment that provides multiple sustainable benefits for the factory and the workers 43 In the following sections this guideline will provide practical advice on training and challenges that are common to all factories in ethiopians ipso It will not discuss technical aspects of training as they are highly dependent on the specific needs of each factory nor will it cover induction training topics as these are addressed in Chapter 3. 3. Analysing training needs the training needs assessment In environments such as modern factories it is necessary to keep track of the skill development needs that exist at different levels Assessing these needs is vital to channel efforts into the areas and departments that will contribute the most to the factory performance A training needs assessment is an analysis of the current skill gaps in the company and includes both technical and soft skills What to assess Training needs assessments can be performed at the organisational task or individual level assessment to identify current gaps at the factory level It allows to focus training efforts on what is really needed to improve performance It requires good understanding of the overall organisation the priorities of different departments and goals and how they all contribute to the overall success of the factory Questions that this assessment can help answer include What are the most challenging What are the recurrent problems the factory faces assessment to understand the gaps in relation to the tasks that each job includes For example when analysing gaps of supervisors in a factory an assessment should look at How are they performing overall What problems do they have What needs to be improved in their job It is recommended to involve department heads assessment analyses the level of performance of employees identifies current skills qualifications their capacity for learning and their willingness to learn It is recommended to involve direct supervisors managers of the individuals How to conduct the assessment There are different ways in which to conduct a training needs assessment Selecting one depends on availability and the type of assessment that will be conducted Below are some suggestions for each type of assessment  Interviews with managers are a good starting point for this assessment as they can provide an overall view of the production process and the main challenges encountered  Interviews with department heads can help understand how each department is performing and what challenges are the most important in relation to skills and internal processes  Interviews with department heads or group interviews with staff can also help to detect gaps in other departments as they inform us about how the relationship and synergy with other departments of the  Surveys with workers help to see things from their perspective and detect issues that might not be clearly perceived by other staff This can contribute to a deeper and holistic understanding of the skill gaps at the organisational level  Interviews with department heads provide insights into the tasks performed by each role in the department and also into the general skill gaps detected among their staff  Interviews with employees contribute to gaining a deeper understanding on the gaps the reasons behind the gaps and how to develop the skills  Direct observation of certain processes is also a valuable source of information to understand skill gaps  Surveys with employees which evaluate their skills on specific tasks help to find common skill gaps in different roles  Interviews with direct supervisors managers provide the first insight to individual employees gaps  Revision of HR records Performance appraisals clarify job objectives that can be linked to specific skills that need to be developed by the employee Training records show what trainings have been provided to the employee and their effectiveness  Interviews with the individuals provide insights into their own perception of their skill gaps their motivation to develop new skills the challenges they perceive and what methods would be most adequate for the candidate When to conduct the assessment It is recommended to do training needs assessments periodically with realistic timelines generally once a year is a good and realistic option however needs can pop up and the HR department should be able to respond quickly to address them To be able to respond promptly the HR department should maintain good communication with all departments Good and regular communication with the different departments will help the HR to both quickly identify skill development needs and to promptly find solutions to bridge the gaps detected What to do with the results of the assessment Once the results of the assessment are analysed and the gaps are identified the next step is to make an informed decision on what gaps to address first and also on the type of action that needs to be taken 1. Set up priorities In case gaps have been identified it is necessary to prioritise Issues related to legal aspects and compliance should be given a higher priority and immediate action must be taken if a gap has been detected in those fields go discrimination corruption insufficient open etc 2. Define the objective of the training After deciding which gaps to address reflect about them determine how the factory would like to solve them and then decide on what goals would be achieved by the training For some gaps training or one short training may be sufficient whereas for others it might be necessary to implement a series of long term actions For example lets imagine that a factory in the garment industry identified a lack of sewing operators To address this issue it was decided that the best way forward is training existing operators to become rather than recruiting new multi skilled operators accordingly the objective was to train 60 sewing operators in the next 4 months From this it is clear that to achieve this objective short oneof trainings will not suffice Training will most likely have to be longterm and could mix relatively intensive training in the beginning and then coaching at later stages 3. Understand the costs Once itis clear what the training programme should achieve and what it should look like make a calculation of the costs of the training actions selected This will include costs of planning preparing material external costs go hiring external trainers and indirect costs such as the employment costs of the workers for the time they participate in the training This will help to also understand how many resources investment the training programme requires 4. But also understand the benefits Calculate the benefits that may be achieved through the training as well Will productivity increase Will turnover decrease A decrease on costs related to court cases What is the financial value of them Understanding what value the training may bring to the factory helps to make a better decision on whether to and how much to invest in the training 5. Calculate roid Having understood the costs and benefits the next step is to calculate the return on investment droid of the training 46 ROI programme costs Please note that these calculations cost benefits and roid will only be helpful when based on real and credible data If there is no such data the data is not reliable or it is not updated then the calculations will lose their meaning and will not be helpful for deciding on whether to invest in training In this case it will be necessary to try to weigh the pros and cons based on other information and apply other rationale to explain the impact of the training documentation The training needs assessment results the evaluation and selection of training plans and all decisions made must be properly documented This will help the factory keep track of past and current assessments and facilitate the understanding of the gaps that have been identified the measures have been implemented to address them and their 4. Developing training capacities in the factory In order to address the need to conduct training factories often assign departments or specific employees to be in charge of this task however regardless of whether the factory has its own training department specific training personnel or a group of employees who train others in any case there are some guidelines needed to ensure the effectiveness of the trainings These guidelines are Clear communication Trainers need to communicate clearly precisely and confidently Effective presentation Trainers should be able to present the information in a way that is easily understood by the target audience They should provide context for the information that is delivered such as reasons effects linkages to other activities etc This will help create awareness and increase of the subject Combination of teaching techniques and participation Trainers should avoid sticking to just presenting information as it is not effective for longterm learning Use participatory methods such as role plays action learning and storytelling to get the message across Audience awareness and gender sensitivity Keep in mind who the audience is and tailor the training to them This involves taking into account criteria such as age level of literacy and gender Special attention should be given to gender aspects to ensure the training is gender sensitive see below for explanation 47 Gender Sensitive Trainings Trainings must be sensitive to the needs of men and woman at every stage Trainings should equally benefit men and women Trainers must understand gender dimensions related to the subject Visual representations should not promote gender stereotypes Cultural aspects regarding gender must be considered For example in certain roles and cultures women tend to be less vocal and shyer In these cases trainers must make a special effort to encourage women to speak up There must be an atmosphere of listening and respect for everyones experiences and views During the training Check the energy level in the group and how well participants understand the concepts Content is king and method is queen Content is key however keep in mind that the method is almost as important as the content Using the wrong training method will result in less impact Skills to follow these guidelines should be developed in anyone delivering training in the factory This includes not only staff in the training department managers but also supervisors including line supervisors as they are in direct contact with workers and have a key role in their development 5. Conducting training Suggested Training Topics Training needs are identified by each organisation through the training needs assessment however based on the analysis of the challenges and needs of manufacturing facilities in ethiopian a list of topics that should be considered for each position is presented below Operators As Ethiopia is relatively new to industrial culture workers in particular those coming from rural areas need to learn not only technical skills to perform their duties but also a set of soft skills that allow them to adapt to the factory environment While most of the training on life skills is done during the further training should be provided for enhancing their understanding of the industry Suggested topics are Productivity Financial literacy and planning oh Team work Work ethics responsibilities and obligations of employees awareness and competence Conflict management 48 The WEAR model An effective training tool that can save costs and time to factories is the use of audiovisual to develop operators soft skills Enterprise Partners has developed the WEAR worker Engagement And Retention tools model to support industrial behavioural change trough audiovisual supported learning tools that introduce workers to 10 thematic soft skill areas In addition to the tools such as facilitators guidelines and flashcards in and are provided to foster engagement in the sessions and facilitate Supervisors The role of supervisors in the factory is one of the most important ones not only in relation to production but also regarding discipline and motivation of the employees Supervisors are in direct contact with the workers and are accountable for their lines often finding themselves in stressful situations Helping supervisors better deal with these situations and their tasks can greatly benefit the factory Studies have found that production lines If workers are promoted to supervisors without being supervised by better prepared supervisors any further trainings the lack of skills and show higher levels of productivity and quality knowledge on managing a team results in pressure and stress for both workers and supervisors As a coping strategy supervisors might adopt unhelpful or even harmful management techniques like verbal or physical awareness and competence abuse Leadership and team building Motivation and feedback Communication in the factory supervisor Skills building programmed Stress anger management Dispute resolution conflict management negotiation skills Harassment and discrimination Disciplinary procedure and labour law Some key training topics to develop the skills of supervisors are Fair Wear Foundation The Fair wear Foundation Managers and middle managers Managers in all levels also need to acquire the skills to work in the environment of export oriented manufacturing facilities Some of the key areas that have to be developed are Workplace communication Leadership and coaching Decision making and skills Dispute resolution negotiation skills 49 Diversity management and harassment Supply chain barriers When most of the top management consists of expats new to the Ethiopian culture conflicts rooted in clashes are likely to arise Providing serious training on competence to the expat managers the Ethiopian middle managers and workers will contribute greatly to a better understanding and communication in the factory 6. Evaluating training delivery effectiveness After the training has been delivered it is highly recommended to evaluate its effectiveness Assessing the success of trainings helps the HR department to Understand what went right and what went wrong Improve future rounds of training Share the impacts of training with the management and the organisation Increase the motivation to invest in training What to measure There are different aspects that need to be considered when evaluating training delivery and effectiveness Evaluate the overall training plan Does the plan cover all the gaps detected in the training needs assessment How many trainings are being delivered How many people have received training Evaluate the effectiveness of technical training How has productivity changed after the training Has quality improved Has the effect lasted long terms Evaluate the effectiveness of soft skills training Have productivity and quality improved How many disciplinary issues have been reported since How satisfied are workers with their supervisor manager 7. How to start Useful recommendations to get started Even when the HR Department knows what has to be done to develop skills in an organisation it might be challenging to take the first step into action Here are some recommendations to make the journey easier Base training on the training needs Base trainings on needs rather than for example on gut feeling or individual suggestions This will guarantee that the trainings have valuable impact and are aligned to the company strategic goals Start with pilot groups lines Training the entire workforce of the factory from the first go can be difficult if not impossible therefore it is not commendable to start too ambitious as this often translates into fast superficial trainings that do not ensure that a real learning 50 process takes place For this reason starting with pilot groups or single lines is a good option It allows to evaluate and show impact and the details for future trainings Trainings should be aligned with the production calendar giving more space to trainings when there is lower pressure on production and limiting the time of the trainings when the pressure is high Notify participants and their superiors early enough at least a week in advance is suggested so that they can rearrange their and find a replacement in time Reminders though the PA system on the day of the training can be helpful to make sure everyone arrives on time Train critical Input from performance appraisals and production data will help identify and organise immediate training for them Do not forget top performers A mistake that must be avoided is to forget about top performers by focusing too much on the critical ones The results can be devastating loss of motivation decrease in productivity and eventually leaving the factory Companies have to take care of their best performing human capital Provide training we go soft skills training to the best workers to increase their possibilities of promotion and keep them motivated They will be able to lead by example and their confidence will be boosted Evaluate the results of training closely In both technical and soft skills training plan how to assess its results and take action If training has been provided to certain lines groups it is useful to observe differences in performance between those who have received the training and those who have not Improve further trainings Work to improve future trainings based on the results of your evaluation Keep good communication with all departments Their feedback is key to detect skill gaps and to understand the impact of trainings 51 HUMAN RESOURCE GUIDELINES Chapter Performance management Performance management is the systematic process of planning work and setting expectations continually monitoring performance developing the capacity to perform periodically rating performance rewarding good performance and taking corrective measures when performance fails to meet factory expectations 1. The importance of Performance Management Performance is crucial to achieve results in any organisation including factories and ipso To ensure high performance in any business it is necessary to develop a performance management system that helps the organisation to align employees and resources with strategic objectives and to make necessary adjustments to avoid or address problems In particular for factories that work in a highly dynamic and competitive global supply chain system the need for performance management is critical as they need to ensure effective performance not only to enhance their competitiveness in the global market but also to meet the needs and expectations of international clients In addition to boosting the competitiveness of the organisation designing an effective performance management system brings about countless benefits for the factory as it Boosts company performance Research shows that organisations that effectively use performance management to develop the capabilities of individuals and teams significantly outperform organisations that do not in areas such as revenue net income and employment corporate Leadership council Aligns team and individuals with the organisation Performance systems provide a tool to align competence of individuals and teams to the strategic goals of the organisation Ensures workplace transparency and clarity Through the performance management talks employees understand their role in their organisation what is expected of them and know how to achieve expected results Creates base for designing development strategies that advance the organisation Based on data collected through performance management organisations can devise and implement continuous improvement programs that further develop skills and expertise of employees and teams Provides a deep understanding on what is affecting performance Organisations understand what factors are affecting performance in all dimensions of the factory and can devise plans to address them 3 Corporate Leadership Council Building the Workforce A Quantitative Analysis of the Effectiveness of Performance Management strategies 52 Provides critical data for supporting decision making Important data can be collected for informed HR decision making we go selection training promotion etc Helps to retain top talent By systematically evaluating performance performance management enables the organisation to identify top talent and reward high performance which can greatly contribute to increasing employees happiness and thereby retention Enhances ownership and employee satisfaction Performance management engages the employees in dialogue which helps develop the relationship with the employee It also enhances ownership by giving employees a say regarding their role in the company and the alignment of their personal goals with organisational objectives As seen above setting up a performance system to build a working culture based on high performance can bring numerous benefits for factories In the case of ethiopian in particular developing and implementing a performance system is highly relevant As the industrial working culture is still in the first stages and therefore most factory employees lack previous relevant work experience it is necessary that factories accompany and guide the development of the workforce to help them achieve performance goals This will require effort time and commitment however such an investment will yield positive results that can help factories tackle some of their most pressing problems 2. The Strategic Role of HR in Performance Management As a general practice it is the HR department who owns leads and coordinates the performance management system in the factories It works together with department heads and provides advice to them on staff performance management issues Such advice can be provided in the following areas Understanding and executing the performance management process Determining the activities that need to be performed in doing performance management Using the performance management tools and templates Dealing with issues or unusual situations that arise during the performance management cycle Helping to realise performance management improvement opportunities Documenting performance records The department heads are responsible in identifying Key Result Areas developing setting and standards and assigning weights for result and competency expectations for Operators and Line supervisors It should be noted however that a key foundation for the performance management approach is that it is grounded in a culture that is supportive of the process and reinforces the actions and behaviours it attempts to reward and recognise This means that for performance management to yield positive 53 results the factory has to work together HR leads and coordinates the performance management system and leaders in the factory not only support and adhere to the processes but also guide and encourage all employees to be active participants in their own performance and career management in the factory 3. The Performance Management Process To be effective performance management in the factory needs to go through five major stages These are Stage 1 Factory goals planning NY Stage 5 Stage 2 Performance Individual intervention Stages of performance performance plan management Stage 4 Stage 3 Performance Managing reviews coaching Stage Factory Goals and Planning In order to be able to reach their objectives factories need to cascade them into measurable elements appropriately to each of their departments This process is usually done by the top management and the board through an annual goal cascading process that starts off the annual performance management cycle for each fiscal years Top level goals can include items such as customer satisfaction product variety quality profitability lead times etc The factory goals should be deconstructed and translated across the factory top management to all departments and levels With cascading and aligning goals employees can understand Exactly what the factory is focused on How their work contributes to the achievement of factory goals 54 The overall department team impact to the performance of the factory Once the factory goals are communicated each department should establish and outline their own objectives aligned to the factory goals This process is led by the department managers with the help of the HR department and it involves Understanding factory goals and the departments role in them Setting performance goals at the department level Defining the departments kris key Performance indicators and establish targets Communicate goals and kris to the departments employees Key Performance Indicator is a measurable value that demonstrates how effectively a company is achieving their objectives in order to evaluate their success at reaching targets A SMART ki is one that is Specific Measurable Attainable Relevant timeframe Stage Individual Performance Plan Once department goals are identified and clarified the process of cascading moves further to every employee of the factory each individual position should be assigned objectives and tasks that are aligned with the department goals Preparing the individual performance plan will have the following outcomes Coming to agreement on the individuals key job responsibilities the key aspects of the job to which attention have to be given Developing a common understanding of the objectives that need to be achieved Identifying important competence that the individual must display in doing the job Creating an appropriate individual development plan Entering a performance agreement between the employee and higher supervisor or manager This process is based on the factory and department goals and job descriptions which describe the roles and responsibilities of all positions in the factory All positions have to be aligned with the goals of the department unit It should be noted that the individual management plan is a result of a joint effort of and employees who define the goals included in the performance plan and assign weights or priorities A template for developing the individual management plan can be found in Annex of this chapter 55 Developing the Individual Management Plan Determining objectives Managers and employees discuss and agree on the objectives of their performance plan together This entails jointly identifying which accomplishments will be included in the performance plan For When defining objectives and targets it is important to Set objectives and targets that are ambitious but realistic focused on improving the factory performance while being fair to the employees and aligned to their knowledge skills and possibilities Actively involve the employee in the process of defining objectives and targets example for a sewing operator in a garment factory two objectives could be becoming a operator who can work with machine and over lock machine and to increase their efficiency in machine by increase from 70 to 80 In the case of a staff The set objectives and targets should not only be understood but also consented by the employee member such as Assistant in payroll the objective could be to process pay checks for all of the employees without error Here it should be noted however that some objectives may be more easily quantifiable but this depends on the position we go objectives for an HR Assistant may not be as easily quantifiable as the objectives of an operator Allocating importance weights to the objectives It might be that not all objectives are equally important For this reason it is necessary to determine which objectives are the most important and allocate weights reflecting the relative importance of the key objectives to each other For example in the case of the sewing operator the first goal becoming a multi skill operator might be more important than others if the factory has a shortage of over lock operators Identify performance measures Measures are the yardstick used to determine the performance of employees Agreement should be reached on how performance will be measured on each performance objective quantity quality timelines andlor cost effectiveness are usually important and applicable in factory work Determine targets Once there is agreement on how the performance will be assessed targets should be defined to determine how successfully the objectives are completed When defining the targets it is necessary to involve the employees actively Industry or factory standards can be used for setting a benchmark For example if average sewing operation in the factory produces 80 pieces per hour and the employee with whom the plan is being developed produces only 60 pieces per hour the supervisor can discuss with the employee and find an agreement of what would be a target that is realistic and attainable but still ambitious with them we go 70 pieces per hour by the end of the quarter 56 Competency planning and should identify the prerequisite competence required to effectively reach the objectives The competence should be tailored to every position and may include both technical competence and soft skills Some common competence for most employees in the factory both at worker and management level include collaboration teamwork communication time management planning leadership and decision making competence also have to be weighted in order of importance and measurements should be assigned to evaluate their development For example for a workers the competency of leadership would weigh less as time management in contrast for a supervisor leadership might be one of the most important Personal development plan Once the objectives are set and the competence necessary to achieve those objectives identified it is necessary to assess the existing competency level of the employee This will help the factory analyse what the employees competency gaps are and based on that develop a learning and developmental plan with the employee to close those gaps Priority should be given to the competence that are needed to fulfil the individual performance plan The process of needs and goals assessment can be facilitated through the use of the Individual Development Plan form attached as Annex Il of this chapter Performance agreement or contract To ensure that each employee is aware of the specific contributions expected of him or her for a predetermined period linked to the performance management cycle a written contract must be established Performance agreements form the basis for development assessment and feedback in the performance management process Once an employees performance is defined in this way it can serve as a living document that the employee and its manager supervisor can use to monitor workers performance throughout the year and assess progress toward achieving higher goals documentation A print out of the plan is sent to a reviewer usually a next level manager for approval If the reviewer demands revisions HR or she shall inform the individuals concerned and agreements need to be reached A copy of the plan is sent to HR within a specified day to 5 days are recommended after the signature of the agreement Resolving differences In case of disagreements between the supervisor and the employee on any component of the plan the next level manager may interfere to help the two reach a consensus If it is not possible to reach a consensus then the case shall be taken to the next upper level manager who makes the ultimate decision which will be binding and final Stage Managing and Coaching After the Individual Performance Management Plan has been developed it is necessary to and monitor regularly to understand how the implementation of the plan is going and to take measures as necessary In the it is necessary that all parties managers employees HR factory leadership have an active role 57 For the Performance Management System to work it should be an ongoing process throughout the year to be monitored through ongoing coaching and feedback across the performance period not a ritual In the need to proactive provide coaching and feedback help build and improve specific capabilities . Co Coaching and giving feedback are skills that must be and remove barriers to achieving learned Factories must ensure that every objectives employee in a position of leadership is trained in the Take record of important events and communication skills needed to provide good achievements of employees regularly feedback listen actively and motivate their as they happen The records should subordinates to boost their performance focus only on those employee behaviours and actions relevant to the job and expectations that are included in the performance plan This can be done in a Performance Log whose template is attached in Annex lily Hold regular discussions to talk about performance This involves informal conversation or notes as well as more formal coaching meetings and written documentation In the discussions indicate both where performance has been improved and where it still needs to be improved In the areas where performance has improved recognise the achievement and appreciate the effort and accomplishment of the employee Give balanced constructive and ongoing feedback both positive and negative focused on improving the workers performance ongoing feedback saves the employees from unpleasant surprises at the appraisal interview Feedback should be given verbally and then appropriately recorded in writing If performance expectations change throughout the years redefine expectations and update the goals and action plan to reflect the change Work hand by hand with their subordinates soliciting ideas and suggestions from the employees for improving work processes identifying barriers to success and strategies for removing or minimising the barriers and discussing their professional development needs Solicit worker feedback on supervisory coaching effectiveness Employees In the employees should be engaged In specific they need to Be actively involved in the definition of their own objectives Identify and discuss performance issues openly immediately with their supervisor Listen and respond to feedback 58 Reflect on their own performance competence and the challenges they face in their daily work It should be clear for all employees that they have an active role in improving their own performance Ask their supervisors for coaching when they need it Human Resources department The HR department needs to support the by Providing training and support to relevant staff to enable them to develop the performance management plans monitor and document them Facilitating the ongoing feedback and coaching Acting as a bridge between the and employees to improve communication and guarantee that feedback is being given when needed Escalating any coaching and feedback problem areas to the next level manager we go poor feedback on the quality of the coaching provided Factory Leadership stop management Factory leadership also has an important role in the whole process of performance management For the they need to Provide support for managers and supervisors on providing effective coaching and feedback Monitor the practice of coaching Supervisors and managers in the factory should do a performance review periodically It is suggested to do it at least The aim of such review is to provide a clear view of how the employee is progressing towards their goals and to offer an opportunity for corrective action The review involves the following activities The supervisor reviews and assesses the employees performance according to the agreed result and competency objectives The employee and supervisor conduct performance review meeting to discuss progress made toward achieving goals as well as additional effort support andlor resources needed The supervisor provides a formal summary and record of the employees performance for the reporting period in relation to the performance objectives and targets agreed Rating performance The performance of a worker on each performance can be rated as one of the five rating categories as defined below 59 Score Rating Definition Exceptional Performance is consistently superior and significantly exceeds Highly Effective Performance consistently meets and often exceeds Proficient Performance consistently meets Inconsistent Performance is slightly below Unsatisfactory Performance fails to meet minimum An option that factories can consider when their performance management system is already advanced are are an important tool to promote ownership among the workforce They allow employees to make a on their achievements difficulties and opportunities while performing their daily tasks moreover itis a helpful tool for the to compare impressions and hold the discussion during the performance appraisal It is recommended to provide a form see Annex ivy to the employees right before their appraisal meeting clarify the purpose of the form and give them enough time to fill it in It should be pointed out that employees may have a different perception of their own performance than the impressions from the and the available data therefore it is crucial that the manager is aware of these differences can provide a fact based explanation to the employees for the differences in ratings where necessary and also be ready to review higher own assessment based on the discussion with the employee Review and approval The completed performance appraisal form has to be reviewed with and approved by the next higher level of management dated signed and returned to the appraising supervisor By signing the form this level of management indicates concurrence with the content of the form and any recommended Signature The performance appraisal form should be signed by all the parties involved employee next level manager An employees signature does not mean herthe agrees with the evaluation results It indicates that the worker and supervisor met to discuss the performance review If a worker refuses to put higher signature it is recommended that the supervisor notes the employees refusal on the form Deadline A stipulated deadline has to be set for performance appraisals Deadlines not being met should be considered unacceptable performance by the in charge and taken into account in the assessment of higher performance In addition must complete the 60 evaluations of their employees they before their own is signed off by their supervising managers Appeal procedure If employees do not agree with their performance appraisal results and the issue can t be handled through discussion with their immediate supervisors they can appeal for reconsideration through the following steps Report the case to the next level in a written letter expressing their complaints Within a few days of receipt of the letter the investigates the causes of the conflict with both the affected employee and its Depending on the matter HR or she may also advice both parties If the complaint persists the makes a final and binding decision Stage Performance Interventions The results of the performance appraisal should be the basis for rewards and corrective actions in the Rewarding employees During the appraisal process top performers can be 11. intention of top performers is of identified should notify the next qa importance in the factory and level manager who in consultation with top management they should be recognized and will make the final selection of those entitled to a reward rewarded for their performance based and also determine the type of rewards on objectives and The reward can be granted either as a promotion salary increase bonus performance pay or a combination of the them depending on the particular circumstances of each staff member Recognition for performance is not always monetary and good performance should be rewarded immediately providing recognition public or private when it is due Addressing unsatisfactory performance Managing poor performance is an integral part of the factory performance management system It looks forward to what can be done by individuals to overcome performance problems and importantly how managers and supervisors can provide support and help Poor performance can be addressed using the following procedures Formal poor performance counselling sessions In these sessions problems of poor performance need to be identified and agreed on between the supervisors and employee These problems may include different reasons such as not receiving adequate support or guidance not fully understanding expectations lack of or unwillingness to perform Counselling is provided depending on the reasons discussed and employees are 61 made aware again of the potential consequences of not complying with performance requirements Performance Improvement Plan An improvement plan should be devised and agreed on to assist the employee in achieving the required objectives and give a fair opportunity to improve performance The plan should indicate the performance problem an action plan a target date and monitoring remarks This plan should be specific and with measurable outcomes to be achieved within a reasonable time period ongoing monitoring and support Adequate instructions coaching and training should be provided to ensure that the employee is able to meet higher objectives and targets Formal disciplinary measures If performance does not improve a series of graduated disciplinary measures should be considered The following is a guide to taking disciplinary measures on the basis of unsatisfactory performance  If a worker obtained unsatisfactory performance for two consecutive review periods the worker will be given final warning in a formal letter of warning  If a worker failed to improve higher performance and obtained unsatisfactory performance for two consecutive review periods as a result of higher to take the opportunity of training counselling guidance and coaching prepared by the supervisor the worker can be dismissed on grounds of fitness or incapacity to carry out his or her duties  If worker obtained unsatisfactory performance for three consecutive review periods the worker is either demoted to a lower grade position or dismissed on grounds of 4. Performance Documentation Documenting performance is necessary as it allows the factory to have records of the discussions held regarding the performance of employees what topics were included what progress has been made towards the goals in the performance plan what issue arose and whether they were address and how therefore as already briefly mentioned above throughout the performance period record of important events and achievements should be collected and kept by the The must determine what data to collect along with all the potential sources of information to be assessed including colleagues employees periodic written reports productivity records incidents and observable employee behaviour Some ideas of what to document are presented below Discussions held with the employee regarding their performance It is necessary to document exactly what the employee did and said and what the did and said in response 62 Both positive contributions improvements achievements and failures in performance including reasons for failure both from employee perspective management perspective with corresponding supporting examples and data Any agreements made during the including goals set corrective actions discussed and agreed upon timeline for improvements Records related to performance should be maintained regularly as they happen in for example the Performance Log a template is available in Annex all of this chapter In the case of negative feedback it is particularly important that supervisors and managers make efforts to express observations as neutral facts rather than judgements and support these observations as much as possible with specific examples and data This will make the observations more accurate and which will contribute to having more accurate performance assessments In addition to regular maintenance of the performance documentation it is important to ensure that all participants in the performance review process sign relevant documents The completed performance planning and review form for each staff member is part of higher official personnel file Copies of the final form will be distributed to the employee and attached to the staff members personal file by HR department 5. Implementation and enforcement of Performance Management Ensure that HR trains coaches and supports all departments while they develop their performance plans The role of HR is especially important in the first stages of introducing a performance management system in the factory Set up clear timelines and deadlines for the development of the performance plan and performance appraisals Ensure that employees are always actively involved in the process of defining their performance objectives and targets This is a crucial basis for all the process that will help prevent conflicts promote transparency and create an overall sense of fairness while increasing employees sense of responsibility and ownership When defining performance objectives and targets keep them real and achievable Setting unrealistic goals can create a great deal of frustration and unhappiness in the employee and as a results negatively impact their motivation If there are major changes in the organisation job objectives can be amended after approval of all involved parties to respond to those changes Address problems with low performers but do not forget about high performers They are the ones who contribute the most to the factory goals and also the ones more likely to be wooed away by competitors Managers and supervisors must spend time talking with high performers about their goals and how the can the factory help achieve them 63 Integrate performance management into daily work Performance management is an ongoing process and the best performance managers constantly solicit give and receive feedback Do not forget to train and coach supervisors and team leaders anyone in charge of the performance management of others in communication skills This will help to prevent conflicts ensure that feedback is given on time increase confidence and improve the work atmosphere Always link promotion to performance Beware of the fact that many supervisors do not want to let go of their best workers and therefore may not give them the chance to grow in the factory ultimately this leads to lower performance and leaving the factory Good performance management systems in place prevent this from happening Remember that performance management is a skill that takes time to build and refined however the results brought about by a performance management system are more than worth the effort The activities primary responsibilities requirements and the supporting tools and templates employed in the above five stages of performance management process is summarized in the following table Activity Primary responsible Supporting tools and templates requirements de fact escape factory  Top Management  Not Required goals and plans 2 .

is any reward or payment given to a worker for services performed It includes wages salaries commissions and bonuses plus insurance and other types of indirect monetary benefits Compensation is a basis for worker satisfaction and therefore will play a great role in retention motivation productivity a harmonious working space and everything that relates to the success of a factory an industrial park and generally speaking a country economy When workers compensation cannot cover living expenses and pay bills dissatisfaction and hence absenteeism and turnover will be the necessary results Dealing with the cause is better than the symptom for sustainable effect 1. The central role of compensation Salary and wages are the main potential conflict area for any factory that wants to start and continue operations in ethiopian as in every other country Not only is it relevant to workers and factories but for the entire international community The reason is simple without compensation that covers basic needs workers won t have access to the quantity or quality of food they need a safe shelter where they can rest buy the goods required for a decent standard of living clothes hygienic products medicines etc This will necessarily end up in bad performance in the factory absenteeism high turnover and conflict The marlow Only the fulfilment hierarchy of needs of the most basic explains ones physiological how motivation is safety needs Self actualization reaching the result of a through access to ones full potential persons attempt adequate food at fulfilling five shelter clothing basic needs in sleep personal and order financial security physiological are a prerequisite safety social to achieve higher esteem and self levels of satisfaction Belonging and love needs actualization and motivation relationships Physiological needs food water shelter and rest 72 however to increase the salary does not automatically solve the workers challenges Factors such as weak financial management from the side of the workers peer pressure to share the wages they get inflation rates especially in areas near Industrial Parks might end up making salary increments meaningless The focus therefore should not only be on setting up higher salaries but on taking a holistic approach to provide benefits that improve the workers living conditions Setting up a competitive compensation scheme will help factories to Attract a sufficient number of qualified workers to fill factory positions Increase worker satisfaction and ownership Retain workers and decrease turnover rates Motivate workers to perform to the fullest extent of their capabilities Improve the positive image of the company among workers and the community This chapter focuses on two aspects of compensation How to set up competitive salaries How to provide benefits that increase the overall wellbeing of workers Living wages A living wage is the minimum income necessary for a worker to meet the basic needs of and higher family including some discretionary income This should be earned during legal working hour limits without overtime Agreement on a living wage should be reached through negotiations between the employer employees and their legitimate representatives preferably through collective bargaining at both industry and national levels 2. Setting up a competitive salary A pay structure has to enable factories to successfully compete in the labour market and be able to attract motivate and retain required workforce by ensuring the right balance between internal equity providing equitable and consistent reward on the basis of each individuals performance and responsibilities and the market rate Setting a fair pay structure which is equitable internally and against competitors is a critical issue in encouraging the performance and stability of the workforce in the factory Factories guiding principles in developing salary structure should be the following Equal compensation for equal work This does not affect distinctions made based on factors such as qualifications and experience Compensation must be comparable to the one offered by other factories inside the park and other companies in the surrounding areas Salaries should consider any loss of purchasing power due to changes in the market factors go inflation 73 The salary structure should properly reflect differences in responsibilities complexity and workload for each position Performance improvement should be driven through incentives variable pay ill Safeguards on Wages  adequate of wage The minimum wage paid whether a fixed wage or piece rate should be adequate to meet the needs of workers and their families taking into account as far as possible and appropriate in relation to national practice and conditions the general level of wages in the country the cost of living social security benefits and the relative living standards of other social groups economic factors including the requirements of economic development levels of productivity and the desirability of attaining and maintaining a high level of employment changes in the cost of living and other economic conditions  payment legal tender made directly to the workers Wages payable in money should be paid only in legal tender and paid directly to the workers Payment should not be made in the form of promissory notes vouchers or coupons Workers must be free to dispose of their earnings as they choose although voluntary thrift may be encouraged If permitted by national laws or regulations collective agreements or arbitration awards wages may be partially paid in the form of allowances in kind where payment in the form of such allowances is customary or desirable provided that they are appropriate and beneficial The value of any payment in kind should be assessed at reasonable market prices  Transparency of payment calculations Payments should be transparent showing clearly the gross wages any deductions taken and for what purpose and net wages due Deductions from wages should occur only if prescribed by national laws or regulations or fixed by collective agreement or arbitration award Deductions for loss or damage to goods should be made only in cases where it has been proven that the worker is responsible Workers should be informed in writing of any deductions made No deductions should be made for the purpose of obtaining or retaining employment paid either to the employer or an intermediary  Regularity of payment Wages should be paid regularly Upon the termination of a contract of employment the worker should be paid a final settlement of all wages due within a reasonable period of time having regard to the terms of the contract  Equal pay for work of equal value Rates of remuneration should ensure equal remuneration for men and women workers for work of equal value  Limits and conditions for deductions for provision of commodities or services by the undertaking Any commodities sold or services provided by the undertaking should be provided at a reasonable price Stores established and services operated by the employer should not be operated for the purpose of securing a profit but for the benefit of the workers concerned There should be no coercion involved in the purchase of goods or services 4 source lot org empent areas

describing every position in the factory to then rank and grade them as a basis for remuneration structuring The aim of this stage is to Identify and eliminate salary inequities and create a fair and equitable salary structure Provide an accurate way of measuring existing new andlor modified jobs Develop and implement a consistent practice to regulate job grading and Ensure that job descriptions are consistent with job evaluation factors In doing this it is advisable to consider factors such as complexity knowledge and skill requirements and workload of the position All employees should be set in the corresponding grade as soon as they start working in the factory The upgrade to a higher position should be in line with performance acquisition of new responsibilities skills or knowledge A worker promoted to a position of higher responsibility will be entitled to a salary increase appropriate to the salary scale level for the new grade into which they are promoted Stage 2 Setting a competitive salary scale After developing an appropriate job grade structure the next step is setting up a competitive salary Key steps to be considered are Review and understand the current factory pay scale if no pay scale has been developed yet develop a plan to do so Analyse the relation between the factorys current salary scales and those of the competitors Establish a system to continuously monitor the living costs in the area Set a factory pay policy for revised or new salary scale design The policy should answer how the factory wants to position itself against the market or competitors Develop incentive schemes for critical job families Setting up salary scales can be done as a joint effort of all the factories in the industrial park provided that their Strict market matching In this approach the only manufacturing processes are similar In relevant decision required is the desired market positioning that would enable the factory to remain competitive in the job market therefore salaries are set by evaluating market pay levels The desired positioning with regards to competitors can be the same for all grades and positions or differentiated by position we go higher than market values for more critical positions and market average for other positions This method requires a significant There are two common approaches that factories can use to design their salary structure particular they could set up a park system to monitoring living costs in the area and agree on a joint basic increment procedure go annual wage increase to balance local inflation 75 accuracy of market data and constant monitoring of market salary changes moreover this approach provides a less structured way to managing careers promotions and salary increases which are key to promote motivation performance and satisfaction in the workforce redefined parameters The second approach which is common and fairly reasonable in the Ethiopian market context is to use redefined parameters that will govern the design of the salary structure Like the first approach this approach also starts with a desired market positioning relative to selected market competitors however the market positioning consideration is only one of the design factors in this approach among many others To ensure equity and transparency this approach defines appropriate salary differentials and salary ranges for the new salary scale The advantage of this approach is that it provides a structure for promotions and career development in the factory Stage Salary administration based on the Labour Proclamation Workers salary may be adjusted annually based on the of the factory In ethiopian wage is deduct protected against deductions attachment and sendoff by the employer ons are only exceptionally allowed in the case of authorisation by law go for tax purposes court order collective agreement if any or work rules or when there is a written agreement of the workers Payroll deductions A factory is required to withhold statutory deductions and relevant taxes from each workers gross salary In addition deductions will be made from a workers salary for benefits such as pension contributions and advances see below Workers should complete the necessary paperwork authorising the HR Department for these deductions either when they start working at the factory or when the deduction will occur in the case of deductions for salary advances All changes to the payroll must be done in writing through a pay change advice Salary advances A salary advance may be granted to a worker owing to unforeseen circumstances which place higher in a difficult financial position requiring assistance from the factory All salaried workers are eligible for salary advance approved by the HR Manager subject to  worker not having any major previous salary advance or disciplinary case  The recovery of the advance has to be made within twelve months and within the contract period  Workers are expected to ensure that they comply with the one third rule their total deductions cannot exceed two thirds of their basic salary Overtime payment Following the labour proclamation the rate of overtime payment varies according to the dates and times in which the overtime is made 76 Time of work Amount to be paid Day time or evening work 1.25 hourly wage rate Night work 1.5 hourly wage rate Work on Rest day 2.0 hourly wage rate Work on Holiday 2.5 hourly wage rate The Ethiopian labour proclamation also states that Overtime can only be done on compelling grounds accident force majeure urgent work and substitution of absent workers Expressed instructions for overtime work from the factory are required workers cannot just spontaneously work overtime The maximum number of overtime hours permitted by law is limited to 2 hours per day 20 hours per month and 100 hours in a years 3. Workers Benefits A benefit is any financial instrument except basic salary that accrued to a worker by virtue of higher employment andlor rank in the factory Specific benefits are stipulated in contracts and collective agreement if existing The benefits that are applicable in a factory are Pension Fund mandatory as per Ethiopian Labour proclamation Rest Period and leave mandatory as per Ethiopian Labour proclamation Because of the special nature of leave it is described in detail in the next chapter Provident Fund Medical benefit Allowances such as transport housing food and other allowances depending on the industry and position Incentive schemes such as attendance and performance bonus Medical Benefits The medical benefit scheme can provide different types of medical coverage andlor attention May cover inpatient outpatient and maternity expenses Should specify ailments or conditions to be covered and Should define the limits of entitlement for inpatient outpatient and maternity expenses Should state the ceiling amount for medical coverage in terms of et A factory can cover medical expenses based on refund of actual expenses in their own facilities in case they have a clinic or through a company contracted medical service provider onsite clinics contracted outsourced private clinics or referral hospitals for more serious cases 77 Pension Scheme Workers who have completed the probation period of 45 days are eligible for the factorys pension scheme in line with what is stated in the Social Security Proclamation for private workers in ethiopian registration Companies shall submit to the government authorities copies of its establishment law personal data of its employee taken at the time of first employment letter of employment issued to the employee and other particulars The time limit for submission of data the registration shall be made within 60 days from the date of establishment or employment Allowances Allowances can be a major component of the total compensation package In order to guarantee workers physiological wellbeing and safety it is recommended that these allowances are provided in kind As stated before allowances paid in cash might end up being used for other urgent matters being shared with the family or being insufficient to cover rising prices in the IP area The factory should provide the allowances listed below Transport allowance Providing transport allowance or service has a significant positive impact on the performance of workers by reducing tardiness and absenteeism and making workers safe Factories are strongly advised to provide the transport allowance in kind centralizing the its transport services can be an option for all the factories in the ip Food allowance Workers nutrition has a direct impact on the level of their productivity and motivation therefore providing food allowance enhances and in many occasions enable workers productivity To this end factories are highly recommended to provide at least one meal per shift to workers either in their own canteens or organising a park centralised meal service House allowance The establishment of an industrial park requires thousands of workers to move to an area As a results housing prices increase making it very hard for workers to have access to decent housing This is a major contributor to turnover tardiness and low productivity To this end it is advisable that factories consider this and work out solutions to this problem Although a housing allowance paid in cash could help the workers to have access to better housing this can just further contribute to the speculation and rising prices of rent It is recommended that the IP andlor factories provides housing for the workers which would have a very positive impact on retention and on workers safety and living conditions 4. Incentive schemes Incentive schemes don t have to be used to reward people only for doing their job as expected by their contracts Bonuses are meant to reward employees for performing beyond the expected or planned Some of the aspects to be rewarded can be 78 loyalty when a worker with good performance stays in the factory over a time period the benchmark must be defined by the factory skills when a worker can perform several different tasks performance producing more than planned by individual effort andlor teamwork attendance unblemished attendance over a period of time Whereas factories are encouraged to develop schemes that reward loyalty and skill development attendance and performance should be included in the compensation from the beginning They help to promote a working culture in which responsibility performance and motivation are considered of high value and therefore rewarded In the context of ethiopian where industrial culture is only starting and many workers are experiencing the pace and requirements of manufacturing for the first time the bonuses can be of great help A Bonus schemes are not a magic cure for low performance nor are they an alternative to good overall practices Low productivity can be a result of a combination of reasons that also need to be addressed to improve performance including communication and leadership issues lack of training and skills a negative working environment etc If the roots of low performance are not addressed incentives for themselves will not have the expected results Attendance For the attendance bonus factories should set up a minimum standard for acceptable levels of absenteeism Based on the standard those who qualified for it have to receive the reward at the end of the months Factories are recommended to set up their attendance incentive from early on as this is a common practice in ethiopian It is important to create a clear and transparent structure for the computation of the attendance bonus and to have a good communication strategy towards the workforce Based on the current practice the following attendance bonus is recommended for operators in the factory Factories should follow their own criteria to define the amount of payment and how will it be done Both authorized and unauthorized absences are counted as an absence for attendance bonus Performance bonus There are various ways of setting up performance incentive schemes but all of them require that the factories are clear about their performance of goals indicators In order to define and set up a performance bonus incentive the factories can follow the next steps Step Identifying job families 79 A factory has to identify those critical work segments or job families that are eligible for performance bonuses A simple table like the one below can help to identify eligible job families Officer Operator Not everyone in the factory needs to be entitled for a performance bonus The job families that are most relevant for the achievement of the factory objectives should be prioritized Step Designing a performance incentive framework The factory needs to consider a number of dimensions in designing a performance bonus framework The most important dimensions are summarized below Which worker categories should be eligible for the programmed All workers supervisors managers middle managers operators etc if applicable What should be the relative share of the bonus out of the total pay or relative to annual base pay Percentage of variable pay out of total pay go to 10 of total pay What format should the plan have commission bonus go commission based on quantity of production relative to a certain daily or weekly standard What performance measures should be used How can individual and group performance be incorporated Results is effort Individual is group absolute is relative to goal is relative to past performance go highly interdependent roles and hence pay should be based on both individual and team performance How frequently should the bonus be paid Annual quarterly monthly weekly go monthly paid with salary How should the payout rate vary with level of performance progressive linear regressive mixed go pay starts only when a certain level of production quantity achieved otherwise zero Pay depends on personal and team performance 80 The choice of a particular option in any dimension of a variable pay programme depends on consideration of different factors such as Extent to which collaboration is needed in the factory Extent to which an individual control the outcome of higher The sophistication of the HR and production function in the factory to administer the performance bonus programmed Factories can consider to pay the performance bonus separately from the salary This can help the workers The need for ease of communication and understand that this is not part of their understanding of the programmed base salary but an award that they Precision of forecasts and plans including receive depending on their targets performance Factories that have already implemented this method have The impact of factors in enhancing proved to achieve better results Nature of positions some positions are relatively more critical in driving factory performance we go operators ie etc and play a key role in driving the growth and productivity Those could be entitled to a higher bonus This helps to motivate these positions even more as their role in fulfilling the objectives of the factory is recognised Control on outcomes positions that have greater control on the results of their actions and decisions we go production may be entitled to more variable pay in their compensation Ease of measurement positions for which accurate measurement of results produced by actions and decisions of position holders is easier we go production may a higher variable pay component in their total compensation Annex of this chapter provides a template that factories can use to develop a performance incentive for a selected job family 5. Communication of salary and benefits Salary payment tends to be the main source of grievances in factories This is in many cases not a consequence of the payment itself but of bad communication and misunderstandings therefore factories have to invest time and effort in making sure that there is a good understanding of the compensation and how it is calculated Clarity on the salary calculations has to be guaranteed from the beginning During the boarding period this topic must be included focusing on the differentiation of their wages allowances and incentives and their calculations Workers have to receive their parsnips monthly parsnips must be written in a language that is understood by all the workers If this is not possible translations of the parsnips should be easily accessible go in posters on the production floor outside HR office employee handbook parsnips should never be written in a foreign language 81 The knowledge provided during boarding has to be reinforced after the workers start receiving their payments so as to prevent feelings of unfairness and confusion about the salary reinforce the importance of performance and attendance and how it reflects in their compensation and guaranteeing that workers are aware of the benefits that the factory provides Participatory trainings with role play group works presentation of cases for workers to analyse and understand are the most helpful Classic trainings that consist only of presentations are not as effective More information on training methods for adult learning can be found in Chapter Training and development Communication on salary and benefits is crucial to prevent misunderstandings and conflicts in the factory Factories are recommended to Implement all of the following measures Include salary benefits and incentives as a part of and reinforce the knowledge with participatory trainings Issue salary pay slips monthly that can be understood by the workers in their own language Include salary benefits and incentive calculations as part of the employee handbook Visual communication in the production floors using posters explaining the pay slip Prepare supervisors to be experts in all issues regarding compensation and how to communicate them to workers Develop strategies for the HR department to be prepared to answer more questions grievances after payday In addition to the trainings the salary calculations and details on the parsnip should be included in the employee handbook and should be visually communicated on the factory floors with posters so that workers can check them whenever they are in doubt supervisors who are in charge of managing workers and are the first to be asked about salary issues should be experts in explaining all the components of the salary to workers along with labour law issues regarding salary payment Factories should give intensive training to supervisors on this topic finally the HR departments should be ready to get questions and grievances from the workers during or immediately after the payday even if these will not be as high if all the recommended measures are implemented Different strategies can be implemented to ease the job of HR and prevent conflicts such as offering a review session before the payday to workers assigning a designated person to ask supervisors if any doubts have been raised after the payment etc 82 Annex Setting up the performance incentive The following template can be used by factories as a tool to develop an incentive scheme for a selected job family To facilitate the reading production operations is used as an example This scheme is prepared for a job family in which both personal and team performance are critical and interdependent hence a matrix plan is proposed in which the payout rate depends both on individual and team performance Components of the matrix Individual performance The rows represent an individuals performance as measured by the weighted average of the persons achievement on key performance indicators for his or her position A persons personal performance is measured relative to the target where represents full achievement of target Note here that for any individual with more than one personal performance indicator a weighted average of all personal performance indicators should be used For details about the setting up of performance indicators refer to Chapter Performance management Team performance The columns represent team performance as measured by the achievement of team production targets Definition of total payment the combination of team and individual performance will define the final value of the performance bonus that the employee will earn based on a percentage of their basic salary This value is to be determined by the factories and can be found in the cells of the matrix 83 Production Operations Matrix plan with performance bonus calculation based on both personal and team performance to of total payment is expected on average Outstanding cases will go up to  0 0 0 0 12 15 18 21 6 21 24 27 30 12 27 30 33 36 18 33 36 39 42 note Both personal and team performance should be evaluated depending on targets The numbers are provided arbitrarily for the sake of example payout is calculated by multiplying the appropriate payout percentage with monthly gross salary payout rates specified in the matrix represent payout as a percentage of the monthly gross salary The figure can be changed into payment per unit by converting performance goal percentage into number of units produced and dividing the amount of variable pay by the quantity of units produced above the target level The matrix is defined relative to individual target grow is team target column percentage achieved Based on performance target level set both individually and as a team Please note Based on the example above the following general features of the incentive scheme are to be noted The numbers at the intersection of the rows and columns are percentages of incentive payments relative to a positions gross salary for the period In the proposed plan the incentive payout rate is zero if either the actual team performance is less than 80 percent of the target or if the actual achievement of the individual target on his or her own kris is 80 percent or less than 80 percent of the target If both the actual team and individual performances are above 80 percent of reference target performance a worker will earn a certain percentage of his or her gross salary for the period as incentive however the percentage of the payout depends on the particular configuration of the actual team and individual performance For instance if an Operator achieves percent of target and the team also achieves percent of target the Operator earns of depending on timing of payout gross salary as an incentive pay For a second example if actual team performance is within percent of target and if workers Individual performance is within 80 to 90 range an Operator receives only of gross salary as incentive The same procedure applies for the remaining combination of Individual and team performance levels The procedure is just to locate the percent applicable for the Individual and the team performance ranges and apply that percent to the workers gross salary or convert it into per unit of production pay For a given level of team performance the incentive pay rate increases as workers performance on his or her own individual performance increases For a given level of individual performance the pay rate increases as the actual team performance increases nonetheless at any one cell in the matrix a worker will hit a better incentive rate by moving down to the immediate next cell in the same column rather than moving right to the immediate next cell in the same row The implication of this is that a worker is rewarded for achieving both his own personal performance and his teams performance But the reward for improving his or her own performance is higher than the reward HR receives for improved team performance which is a collective achievement Useful references

management 1. The Importance of Leave Management Leaves of absence are a fact of life Proper leave management is necessary not only to comply legal obligations but also and equally importantly to help the business operate more effectively and to address the employees needs for Over the past years more data has come out supporting the benefits brought by granting extended leave to the employees According to studies taking periodic breaks allow employees to refresh and be more engaged at work which in turn can lead to an increase in productivity of up to and revenues for the organisation can triple The benefits are however not limited to productivity Encouraging employees to take time off helps improve employees happiness retention and prevent burnout Recognising the importance of giving time off to employees the Ethiopian Labour Law entitles workers to paid leave 2. Types of Leave By the Ethiopian Labour law employees have the right to different types of leave A summary of the types of leave can be found below however for more detailed information on the legal provisions regarding leave please refer to the Ethiopian Labour law Rest day Although it is not technically a type of leave employees have the right to at least one rest day per week normally employees are not required to work on their rest day Working on the weekly rest day may be allowed only for compelling grounds and payment for overtime work done on the rest period as stated in Chapter 6 Compensation under Overtime payment Annual Leave According to the Ethiopian Labour law every employee is entitled to paid annual leave duration The amount of annual leave depends on the length of service One year of service entitles the employee to a minimum leave of 14 working days For every additional year of service the leave is 14 working days plus one working day for every additional year of service actor Shawn Are the People Who Take Vacations the Ones Who Get promoted Harvard Business review Retrieved from org 2015 06 are the people who take vacations the ones who get promoted 86 payment Annual leave cannot be converted into money In cases of termination however the annual leave not taken by the employee shall be paid The payment received during the annual leave has to be equal to the employees normal payment equal to what the employee would have received if herthe continued to work Sickness during leave If an employee falls sick on annual leave then sick leave applies recall An employee who is on annual leave may be recalled for compelling reasons An employee who is recalled from leave is entitled to a payment covering the remainder of higher leave excluding the time lost for the trip The employer shall pay the transport expenses incurred by the employee that has been recalled and also per diem Requesting leave For each leave of absence employees need to go through the formal procedure of filling leave please refer to the form attached as Annex and Ii of this chapter Annual Leave for New Employees Employees who have less than in the factories are not eligible for any paid annual leave however this usually leads to an increase in the rate of unauthorised absenteeism To manage this issue factories should consider granting annual paid leave not after the first year but after the first 6 months in the factory Sick leave To be eligible for sick leave an employee has to have completed the probation period Sick leave will apply in cases in which the sickness is not resulting from employment In case the sickness is due to employment injuries then the relevant provisions of the law apply When the employee is absent due to sickness herthe has to notify the employee the day following higher absence In addition herthe needs to bring a valid medical certificate from a recognised heath centre health centre includes both private and public health centres unless it is waived by the collective agreement The sick leave is for a maximum of 6 months Payment during the sick leave is granted as follows Sickness Period Amount The first one month Full wage The next two months Half wage The last three months No pay 87 Maternity leave Pregnant employees are entitled to time off for medical examinations connected to the pregnancy provided that they present a medical certificate of the examination conducted No deductions from the can be made for this time off prenatal leave Pregnant employees are granted leave with pay for 30 consecutive days months preceding their due date postnatal leave Pregnant employees are granted 60 consecutive days months of paid leave after giving birth Other specific additional leave shall be granted upon doctors recommendation This leave shall also be paid The difference between prenatal leave and postnatal leave is clearly stated in the labour proclamation and they are not interchangeable Holiday leave Recognised public holidays are paid leave meaning that wage may not be deducted This includes as defined in the public holidays proclamation Other holidays including regional holidays that are not included in the public holiday proclamation are not considered as paid leave Factories should be aware of these regional holidays and act at their own discretion Special leave with pay For any of the following cases the employee should notify the employer in advance and present the necessary evidence as requested by the employer Marriage of the employee The employee is granted 3 working days of paid leave bereavement mourning The employee is granted 3 working days of paid leave in case of death of relative Union leave Paid leave is granted to trade union leaders

discretion of the employer unpaid leave for various reasons thus when an employees need for a longer leave cannot be entertained by the leaves discussed above leave without pay can be arranged by agreement Study leaves Study leaves may be granted but the specifics are to be regulated by collective agreements if any or work rules 3. Unauthorised Leave Unauthorised leave of absence is when the employee fails to come to work without a justifiable reason thus it does not include any of the cases presented in the previous section Factories should be concerned about unauthorised leave as a high level of can cause significant costs to the factory coming from disturbances in planning and not being able to meet targets due to lack of employees therefore managing unauthorised leave should be a priority for factories right from the beginning The factory leadership and all supervisors down the hierarchy need to set the tone about unauthorised leave during the induction period in refreshing trainings and through spontaneous reminders After communicating a clear message when unauthorised leave happens the responsible supervisor needs to conduct interviews which can help identify reasons and work on preventive measures To manage unauthorised absence due to issues factories should include regular reviews with sick employees planning workplace adjustments and involving occupational health professionals In this way factories can contribute to employees returning faster and preventing absences due to the same reason from repeating Other tools to manage unauthorised absence may include wellbeing surveys to acquire a deeper understanding of different factors that may influence unauthorised leave such as employee satisfaction wellbeing levels of work stress experienced by employees and also conflicts at the workplace 89 4. Enforcing the leave policy During all employees should received as a printed handouts the different kinds of leave to which they are entitled and the procedures for requesting them A sample is provided in Annex ill of this chapter In order to better manage employees absence it is necessary to properly track each employees combined authorised and unauthorised annual leave a simple Leave Summary is provided in Annex IV of this chapter for this purpose This will help the factory understand how much time is lost per employee and may also contribute to calculating the costs incurred because of lost productivity needs to reshuffle workers to cover for absent ones etc Monitoring and collecting absence related data can also help shed light onto the extent and cause of absence issues All the information collected can then help the management to make informed decisions and build a strategy to manage absences more effectively The measures to be taken in case of unauthorized leave should be part of the disciplinary procedure of the company where the detailed consequences of this type of absence must be clearly stated prefer to chapter Disciplinary procedure Annex Guidelines for the classification of offences and progressive disciplinary sanctions Managers and supervisors have to enforce this policy from the beginning Supervisors managers should first talk to the worker to understand if there is any justification for the absence and emphasise the importance of asking for leave In cases of absence without acceptable reasons a written warning can be handled to the workers After 5 consecutive days of unauthorized leave if there is no reason from the side of the employee that justifies the absence the company is allowed to dismiss the employee Useful absence measurements Lost time rate the percentage of possible working time lost to absence Frequency rate the average number of absence periods per employee Once leave is regularly tracked and analysed trends can be identified to analyse causes and address the root of the problem if any identified in order to take preventive measures 5 Employers can ask for supporting documents to assess whereas an employee had an acceptable reason for the absence go a letter written by local authorities or an informal support group called for mourning leave medical certificates for sickness court or police letter for any

working place The grievance procedure when drawn up carefully and implemented consistently lead to better workplace satisfaction and employee engagement as well as to more productivity moreover management in factories can use the information obtained through the grievance procedure to come up with creative solutions to deal with issues that employees bring to managements attention Studies conducted on functioning grievance handling systems in factories have shown that the existence of an effective grievance handling procedure leads to better relationships in factories more productivity lower absenteeism lower turnover rates however grievance mechanisms have to function well to achieve these results Factories not only in Ethiopia but all over the world sometimes have grievance mechanisms that are just a formality to comply with client requirements Factories should not be proud not to have any grievance as this does not necessarily imply that employees do not have any issues to report but in fact that employees do not know how the procedure works or do not trust it 7 Fair Labour Association How a functioning Grievance procedure may positively impact a factorys performance John Kennedy School of government Harvard University grievance mechanisms A guidance tool for companies and their stakeholders 96 Guiding principles for the establishment of grievance procedures according to the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights 1. legitimate The grievance mechanism should be perceived as legitimate by the affected stakeholders groups management supervisors and workers and should be jointly designed and overseen by the factory and those stakeholders groups concerned in order to generate trust 2. Publicised and accessible The grievance mechanism should be publicised and readily accessible by all parties therefore it should be available in all relevant languages spoken in a region 3. transparent The grievance mechanism should operate on a presumption of transparency of process we go investigation and results while allowing for dialogue to remain confidential 4. Based on engagement and dialogue The grievance mechanism should focus on engagement and dialogue between the parties with the aim of identifying sustainable rights compatible solutions that are acceptable to all and that will contribute to a better working environment 5. Predictable in terms of process The grievance mechanism should provide predictability in terms of the key steps and options within the process should be where appropriate and provide for agreed outcomes to be monitored 6. Fair and empowering The grievance mechanism should seek to redress imbalances in power knowledge and influence between the company and potential complainants to enable informed dialogue a shared responsibility for outcomes and a process based on respect 7. A source of continuous learning The effectiveness of the mechanism should be measured and cumulative lessons from complaints should be reviewed to identify systemic changes needed to either company practices or the workings of the grievance mechanism 1. How to establish effective grievance handling systems No matter which the grievance mechanisms established in the factory are there are certain guidelines that can be followed in order to create effective transparent fair and empowering practices There should be commitment from factory management to acknowledge and address employee grievances Involvement of management in grievance process helps to give this process the importance it should have in the factory and guarantee that grievances will be used to improve factory practices at all levels If management neglects grievances it is likely that the grievance procedures will not be fully implemented will be ineffective One grievance mechanism the formal procedure that is usually set up in the factory is usually not enough to address all the challenges and problems that can be channelled through grievances therefore factories should have a combination of informal method of addressing grievances go through communication with workers representatives counsellors team leaders or and formal methods of submitting grievances through the use of anonymous methods go suggestion box or grievance 97 Employees should be trained and encouraged to share their grievances and concerns Clear and consistent communication of procedures through periodic refresher training and inclusion in the employee handbook must be provided moreover a working environment that is open for suggestions and that values opinions of employees should be created in the factory It should be clearly communicated to workers that grievances must be first raised and addressed internally following the grievance mechanisms that the factory has established before appealing to any other instance that is external to the factory While all employees should receive training on grievances factory key position holders should be prepared more thoroughly Team leaders supervisors and managers must receive training on how to received address solve communicate and document grievances Workers representatives can help not only to address grievances but also provide ideas on designing grievance mechanisms in a way that the procedures are adjusted to the needs of workers Workers representatives should also be trained in grievance handling and be involved in the process along with the management Once a grievance issue is solved there shouldbe a HR departments should keep records timely transparent and consistent feedback on the outcomes of handling the grievance issue It should be communicated to the employees concerned if confidential in nature and to the wider employee body if the case affects all or a significant majority of employees of all the grievances document how they have been handled and post the outcomes and actions taken for the grievances that affect the majority of the employees This will not only generate trust but also encourage Grievances should be actively used to refine policies them to further communicate their procedures and factory practices grievances An effective grievance handling procedure helps factories not only to address but also should be perceived and used as a tool to identify potential grievance issues It should help factories to solve the grievances in the shortest time possible with no or little disruption to the factorys operation 2. Whistle blowing Whistle blowing is the act of alerting the management or employer about alleged acts of dishonesty and or illegal acts and misconduct at the workplace In some instances grievance procedures are coupled with whistle blowing practices to ensure that employees feel safe enough to report illegal and unethical actions of colleagues andlor supervisors without fear of negative repercussions Employees may occasionally opt to report grievances alleged acts of dishonesty and for illegal acts and misconduct at the workplace anonymously This can be done either by using a simple note that is inserted into a suggestion box or a telephone line operated by an independent third party assigned by the organisation In both cases the HR department is responsible to collect as much detail as possible and respond to employees in an open forum since there is a possibility of not being able 98 to identify a particular employee as an aggrieved party A reasonable timeline to investigate the grievance and provide a would be established based on the particular situation of the organization suggestion grievance hopes If the company decides to use these boxes there should be a review procedure that establishes  Responsible party for opening the box Specific timeline to open the boxes  Recording procedure including register of the grievance the action taken and how it is communicated to employees 3. Developing a grievance mechanism The grievance mechanism should be designed by each factory ideally the HR department will involve workers representatives counsellors team leaders or in the development of the procedure to have a clear idea of what are the main grievances that should be prevented and addressed from an early stage The following is an example for a grievance mechanism in the factory the stages time periods and responsibilities described are based in common practices but should be adapted to each factory 1. The aggrieved employee the one who has a complaint to express should first discuss higher grievance with the immediate supervisor verbally within 5 working days of the incident causing the grievance The immediate supervisor should provide a verbal response and solution within 7 working days of the presentation of the grievance If for any reason this does not happen or the response and solution prove unsatisfactory the employee may take higher case to the next level authority in writing In case the grievance concerns the immediate supervisor the incident would be presented to the next level of authority from the beginning The next level of authority shall provide a written response and solution within a period of 7 working days herthe should take the case to the next level authority to prove inadequate the employee may arrange a grievance meeting with the human resources ihr office by filling a formal grievance form The grievance form should clearly indicate a complete description of the issue involved the date of the alleged incident and references to a specific policy allegedly to have been improperly applied It should also indicate the responses received from earlier stages HR will review the grievance form and the aggrieved person will receive a written response within 5 working days of receiving the completed form HR will interview the employee in the presence of workers representative if so desired by the aggrieved employee immediate supervisor and the next level of authority to obtain a complete picture of the grievance and subsequent steps taken If the response provided by HR is not satisfactory the employee may present the grievance to the highest authority in the organisation 99 6. In some cases a grievance may be presented by workers representatives when there are multiples of aggrieved employees In this case a joint consultation between the HR department and workers representative would be held to resolve the matter as swiftly and as effectively as possible 7. HR is responsible to prepare a grievance log with details of grievance incidents A grievance log is a document prepared by the HR of the organisation to provide a complete documentation of the grievance incident and the remedial action taken by the organisation with the aim of providing future reference on the incident A template is provided in Annex II to 8. If the aggrieved employee chooses to remain anonymous then the whistle blowing process must be applied 4. Beyond grievances towards improved communication and practises The existing grievance handling procedures should be regularly reviewed and improved to ensure that grievance issues are being founded and resolved It is important to keep in mind that lack of grievances being communicated and the factory is still facing high turnover low productivity and low motivation should not be considered as a good sign but as a sign of alarm that the communication channels in the factory are not effective Whereas the establishment of grievance procedures can be achieved in the short to medium term grievance boxes the establishment of a system for recording grievances etc finding long term solutions that improve the communication between workers and managers is a continuous process that focuses on an overall improvement of communication and dialogue in the factory The development of dialogue practices in the factory enable workers and managers to acquire skills and knowledge to improve effective communication enhance cooperation and mutual understanding and to develop participatory organisational structures that promote sustainability in the factorys existing practices Providing counselling both about work and personal issues is a valuable tool to channel the concerns of workers as they might not only be related to the factory but to their new living environment Although it may not always be able to solve the problems faced by the workers it can offer much needed psychological support and thereby alleviate some of the feelings of frustration and being overwhelmed experienced by the workers This can help to increase the sense of wellbeing among workers and in this way help factories to increase retention An effective grievance handling procedure not only helps to address current issues It should also be used as a tool to identify trends and its causes in order to design preventive measures that help solve them in the shortest time possible with no or little disruption to the factorys operation 100 Annex Employee Grievance Form To be completed by an aggrieved employee and submitted to 1.

Development and enforcement of disciplinary procedure The disciplinary procedure should be applied equally to all employees of the factory regardless of their contract status indefinite period definite period casual employment position in the organizational level workers supervisor manager etc or nationality expats and Ethiopian nationals The Ethiopian labour proclamation establishes the basis for termination with and without notice on disciplinary grounds Factories must make sure to follow the provisions stated in the labour proclamation 104 Employee conduct which may warrant disciplinary action and sanctions that may be applied are listed as Annex to this chapter Even if it is not possible nor practical to list The listed sanctions cannot be an exhaustive list of every possible misconduct in a factory some all offences that may be committed in a factory this common misconduct that workers tend to would be a neverending list therefore all incur in should be listed and communicated to employees should be aware that they may be workers such as disciplined in respect of any conduct if the Sleeping in the workplace employee knew or ought to have known that the Using the in the work conduct constituted grounds for disciplinary action place As mentioned factories should consider in every Eating in the workplace case the circumstances and seriousness of the Not using the adequate pie Taking away company products outside the factory  Tardiness at arrival time and after breaks and leaving earlier without permission misconduct any instances of repeated misconduct the employees circumstances the nature of the job and generally the application of the principles of corrective discipline and consistency with the need for each case to be judged on its own merits It is recommended that counselling is provided to employees that have committed first time minor offences A short informal talk with the immediate supervisor is recommended in which the consequences of the offence are explained to the worker both on the productivity aspects go increase of workload on peers delayed delivery time and on the disciplinary consequences to the specific employee  Maintain fair just and consistent discipline Ensure employees are aware of the standards of acceptable behaviour expected from them Comply with all rules and procedures of the employer Comply with the law Behave in an orderly and lawful manner Familiarize themselves with the employers policies and procedures Educate employees on Organizational procedures through disseminating policies and procedures  Train managers on handling disciplinary procedures  Guide Supervisors and Employees on corrective procedures 105 2. Types of disciplinary sanctions Whereas the seriousness of the misconduct is what determines how the offences will be dealt with for reference see Annex to this chapter the types of disciplinary sanctions that can be taken by the factory are Verbal warning In the event of a minor offence on the part of the employee the disciplinary action will be a verbal reprimand The immediate supervisor will inform the employee of the intention to discuss the minor misconduct and advise them of their right to bring employee representation to the discussion The immediate supervisor will bring the misconduct to the employees attention determine the reasons for the misconduct and give an employee the opportunity to respond to the allegations and will seek to get an agreement on how to remedy the conduct After hearing the employees submissions if the immediate supervisor deems it appropriate herthe may issue a verbal warning reiterating the proper conduct expected of the employee The employees immediate supervisor will maintain a record of verbal warnings issued The verbal warning is valid for 3 months from the date of issue Repeat offences will follow a progressive sanction Written warning An employee may be given a written warning by the Immediate supervisor where the seriousness of the misconduct warrants one The immediate supervisor will bring the misconduct to the employees attention The employee will be requested to attend a meeting with HR present and may be represented by a fellow employee or employee representative The immediate supervisor will determine the reasons for the misconduct and give an employee the opportunity to respond to the allegations and mitigating circumstances if required If after hearing the employees submissions the immediate supervisor deems it appropriate herthe may issue a written warning reiterating the proper conduct expected of the employee The Immediate supervisor may issue a written warning to correct the behaviour HR will ensure that the sanction is appropriate as per policy and labour proclamation and signs the letter jointly The immediate supervisor must capture the warning accordingly and the employee must acknowledge receipt thereof If the employee refuses to sign the warning letter the immediate supervisor must hand in the letter in the presence of an HR representative or another employee who will act as witness The witnessing employee and must sign in confirmation that the written warning was conveyed to the employee The written warning must be filed in the employees file The warning remains valid for six months After six months the written warning will expire unless there is another offence committed within the period 106 If during the six month period the employee is subjected to disciplinary action on a same or related offence the written warning may be taken into account in deciding the appropriate sanction Final Written warning In cases where the seriousness of the misconduct warrants a final written warning the immediate supervisor and HR may give the employee a final written warning a fellow employee or staff representative The Immediate supervisor will determine the allegations and present mitigating circumstances if so required herthe may issue a final written warning reiterating the proper conduct expected of the employee The immediate supervisor and HR may issue a final written warning to correct the employees behaviour The final written warning is valid for twelve months Dismissal In cases of serious misconduct and very serious misconduct an appropriate sanction including dismissal may be imposed All dismissal decisions should be consulted with a legal advisor in order to avoid litigation as a result of unlawful termination 3. Best practices for an effective disciplinary procedure disciplinary procedure is effective only when it is applied fairly and consistently Best practices in an effective disciplinary procedure include Documenting all procedures and actions taken when handling offenses none documentation of procedures will not only lead to confusion inside the factory but will also have negative consequences if a case is taken to court by the employee Factories must make sure that everything related to a disciplinary case is documented including proof if applicable Training and communication to employees and the HR department  Every member of the had must be an expert on handling disciplinary cases since they are in charge of managing all relationships in the factory  next supervisors who are the first line of contact with workers and usually have to operate under pressure from the management and the team have to have a thorough knowledge of the violating behaviours and how to handle disciplinary cases In order to prevent conflicts supervisors must also be trained on how to manage stress and teams If they lack this ability they are more likely to ignore the procedures that must be followed in cases of misbehaviour which can end up in legal cases in which the factory can easily lose 107  Management has to be knowledgeable and highly compliant with the factory own disciplinary procedure In particular expats managers have to be aware of the legal steps that must be followed in the country in order to take disciplinary action  Employees should be informed and regularly reminded of the rules of behaviour in the factory A mere list of good and bad behaviour may not be enough as they also need to understand how offences have negative consequences for the factory and for their coworkers Applying action learning methods in which workers deal with complex issues develop solutions take empowered action learn from each other and engage in reflection can help workers to better understand and follow the disciplinary Visual reminders of the most common disciplinary offences are a good way to remind the workforce about what is considered good and bad behaviour in the factory Photos and graphics will have more impact that just texts describing the code of conduct of the organisation Understand the causes behind offences If certain offence is being committed regularly in the factory this should be seen as a sign of lack of knowledge misunderstanding or other underlying issues HR should understand the causes behind the offence and prepare a strategy to prevent further misbehaviour It is recommended to involve workers representatives in this process Clear and predictable consequences The consequences of offence should be clear predictable for everyone and applied consistently among all the workforce Register all disciplinary actions Disciplinary offences and the actions taken should be registered and tracked in a Disciplinary action log This will allow to detect trends on the main sources reasons and departments that are more problematic to the factory and take preventive action A template for the development of the Disciplinary Action Log can be found in Annex Il to this chapter Learn from experience The lessons learned from the development and application of the disciplinary procedure should also be documented and used for future improvements in the execution of policies communication or training following an approach of continuous improvement 4. Code of conduct and work ethics While the code of conduct is usually developed by the A code of conduct is a key governance best practice that guides management factories are your business policies procedures and practices moreover encouraged to make it a it helps to ensure compliance with international standards participatory activity as it will and national laws and regulations that are applicable to all more likely achieve full activities in the factory implementation and integration moreover a code of conduct serves the factory to within the organization when employees are involved in its Show employees that the factory is has a genuine creation interest in doing business responsibly 108 Show clients brands that the factory values integrity A code serves as a public statement of what the company stands for and its commitment to high standards and right conduct Brands and other stakeholders appreciate that some attempt is being made to develop a company culture of responsibility and honesty sensitive employees to things that may not have been obvious to them and avoid inadvertent yet potentially harmful missteps Provide a clear point of reference when enforcing corrective action 5. Basic principles of work ethics While the code of conduct should reflect the organizational values of the company there are certain topics that are recognized as relevant by the international community Equal employment opportunity Equal employment opportunity is the principle that ensures all employees and potential employees are treated equitable and fairly regardless of their race ethnic background religion sex marital status age physical or intellectual impairment or sexual preference This principle aims to ensure that all employees are given equal access to opportunities through all the stages of the employment life cycle without considering any factor that is not related to their competence or ability to perform their duties An equal employment opportunity employer is committed to the implementation of fair equitable and practices to create an inclusive company culture that fosters acceptance and respect for diversity anti Harassment and Violence This principle aims to ensure that no employee is subjected to any form of violence or harassment while at work Workplace violence may not always be a critical or extreme situation from the outset It sometimes follows a pattern of escalating behaviour from agitation expressed anger or frustration and intimidating body language to abuse and threats physical threats or assault Harassment is a type of violence that can be defined as any unwelcome action any action which the harassed knows or ought to reasonably know is not desired by the victim by any person whether verbal or physical on a single or repeated basis which humiliates insults or degrades Sexual harassment Sexual harassment can happen in any organization and should be taken seriously by all factories It can be defined as any unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature that makes a person feel offended humiliated or intimidated In labour intensive factories such as garment it should be especially prevented as some of its characteristics such as power differences vulnerability of the workers 109 high pressure to meet production targets are factors that can lead to a hostile working environment anti Corruption Factories should commit to prevent and eliminate any attempt or possibility of corruption or bribery in particular in key positions that might affect the company performance and reputation For this clear guidelines should be set to clarify what are acceptable practices and what is considered as bribery andlor corruption Conflict of interest A conflict of interest arises in the workplace when an employee has competing interests or loyalties that either is or potentially can be at odds with each other In order to prevent this situation the factories can define rules to outline what is considered as conflict of interest and how any conflict in this area will be resolved Child labour The International Labour organization defines child labour as work by children under the age of work by children under the age of 15 that prevents from attending to school and work by children under of age of 18 that is hazardous to the physical or mental health of the child According to the Ethiopian labour proclamation article the statutory minimum age for young workers is 14 years The minimum age for hazardous work in Ethiopia is set as 18 years and workers between the ages of 14 to 18 years are classified as young workers Factories are encouraged to develop a policy to clarify the acceptable age for their workers and to prevent the employment of children for example mechanisms to verify the age of a candidate when in doubt Occupational Health and Safety Factories should be committed to maintain a safe working environment and to develop procedures to eliminate or mitigate any hazard or potential hazard at the workplace This includes setting up a safe infrastructure developing and enforcing a policy for health and safety and providing the workers with training and the required personal protective equipment Forced labour According to lot forced labour can be understood as work that is performed involuntarily and under the menace of any penalty It refers to situations in which persons are coerced to work

demotion and termination Factories typically have a large workforce with different skill levels One of the inevitable consequences is that at any given time staff movement into within and out of the work environment is bound to happen This chapter is intended to provide a guideline about the steps and process to be followed for internal employee movement which includes Transfer Promotion Demotion Termination 1. Transfer Employee transfers are an ideal method to encourage the development of the employees career within the company and fill vacant positions from internal sources In transfers existing employees are given the opportunity to fill vacant positions with no change to grade This may be done through an internal vacancy announcement or direct assignment after reviewing documents in the personal file of employees Transfers can be made for the following purposes To increase the effectiveness of the organisation To increase the versatility and competency of key positions To deal with fluctuations in work requirements To correct in employee relations To correct erroneous placement To relieve monotony To adjust workforce transfers it should be noted are not to be confused with that assignment to a less desirable position as a consequence of a disciplinary offense Transfers involve moving employees to fill vacant positions which are on the same grade as the employees previous grade due to valid reasons such as interest from the employee and in some cases restructuring or of a position Transfers occurring due to restructuring or of a position are a last resort measure short of termination of employment with notice as per the provisions of the current labour proclamation It is recommended that the factory develops its own transfer policy The policy should be impartial and transparent meaning that it should be known to all employees In general a good transfer policy should at the minimum Bein writing and communicated to all employees Clarify the types of transfers and the conditions under which they will be made 117 Clarify the procedure for transfers how they may be initiated how information is shared and communicated to the employee how the decision for approval is taken etc Clarify the payment that the transfer will receive Clarify whether training or retraining is required Clarify whether the transfer is permanent or temporary Not be made arbitrarily without valid reasons To avoid claims of problems such as unfair staff treatment during the implementation of a transfer decision it is important to have a discussion with the concerned employee about the decision and formalise this discussion by issuing a formal letter with details of the assigned position the effective date of transfer and the reason for the transfer decision 2. Promotion A promotion is the internal advancement of an employee from one job position to another one with a higher salary range higher job title and job responsibilities Managing promotions effectively is an important way to motivate employees and drive the success of the company Promoting from within the current workforce provides the best opportunity for factories to show their appreciation and commitment to the career development of their employees furthermore when employees believe that the promotions are managed effectively they are twice as likely to put more effort in work and to plan a longterm career within the company therefore it is recommended a clear promotion process that considers an employee who has consistently displayed a performance rating of proficient highly effective or exceptional for a higher position when opportunities for growth are available within the factory Transparency in Promotions Promotions can be a delicate topic within the organisation therefore it is necessary that the process of promotions is transparent so that employees have a clear idea of how promotions are made and thereby prevent situations in which employees perceive that promotions in the company are unfair A good understanding of the promotion process means that all employees clearly understand How the process of promotion is initiated What the criteria for selection are which means they also understand what they need to achieve and do in order to get a promotion How the decision of who is promoted is made and by whom 1 romans je ca bush my ca How You Promote People Can Make or Break Company culture Harvard Business review Retrieved from org 2018 01 how you promote people can make or break 118 Promotions may be initiated in different ways A common way however is when the promotion is initiated by an existing employee who aspires to fill a position of a higher job grade within the factory through an application To ensure a fair and transparent process of promotion it is recommended to follow the provisions of the internal recruitment process please refer to Annex If of Chapter whereby The existence of a promotion possibility is communicated to all eligible employees through an internal vacancy announcement prior to or at the latest in parallel with an external vacancy announcement Employees have adequate time to apply for the position Employees are clear about the criteria to be used for selection we go required education experience skills past performance record and also about the process Similar to transfers promotion decisions are best implemented when results of internal recruitment process are communicated to employees through a face to face discussion followed by a formal letter both to those who are selected for the promotion and those who are not successful in their application 3. Demotion Although rare in practice in the Ethiopian labour market demotion decisions can be made in factories in response to a pressing reason that makes it necessary to have an employee to work in a position of a lower job grade than they were initially employed for emotions can happen for different reasons In voluntary emotions the employee requests an adjustment to circumstances and current needs of higher life In compulsory emotions a demotion can be a measure taken due to the employees failure to perform at the job shelve was hired for or promoted to or as a measure taken as a result of restructuring in the organisation In most of the cases however the causes of demotion typically emanate from the employees inability to perform a significant part of their current responsibility because of A gap in the recruitment process whereby the employee has successfully completed higher probation period but has failed to perform to acceptable standards temporary partial disability health challenge that result in reduced performance levels not because of lack of willingness but from lack of ability that cannot be addressed by termination of employment contract for reasons of incapacity A disciplinary offense that does not fall within the current provisions of the disciplinary procedure and does not warrant a termination of employment contract emotions are never an easy task A demotion can be embarrassing for the employee and if the demoted employee was a supervisor it might be difficult for the employee to join the people herthe once managed In the end when the demotion is not voluntary it can greatly deactivate the employee which is not beneficial for the company and in cases in which the demotion is used to discipline the employee it will most likely not help to fix the misconduct therefore itis recommended 119 to avoid compulsory emotions Use them as a last resort or when strictly necessary and try to take into account all facts in the matter before reaching the decision Once it has been decided that a compulsory demotion is absolutely necessary it is important to consider that a demotion is bound to elicit an emotional reaction from an employee therefore as in all staff movement decisions make sur to communicate in a discussion with the concerned employee first and then follow with formal communication through a letter 4. Termination Termination of employment contracts can be initiated either by the employer or the employee as per the provisions in the Ethiopian Labour law Since these guidelines do not attempt to duplicate such provisions refer to the Labour Proclamation for more information regarding termination of employees In this section aspects which are complementary to the provisions of the proclamation and the disciplinary procedures of the guideline are presented instead According to the Ethiopia Labour Law proclamation a contract of employment May be terminated by either employee or employer according to the legal provisions in the Labour Law or the collective agreement or the agreement between the two involved parties Shall terminate by law on the expiry of the contract period or on the completion of the work where the contract of employment is for a definite of work upon the death or retirement of the workers when the undertaking ceases operations permanently or when the workers is unable to work due to partial or permanent incapacity Shall terminate by agreement when the parties agree to the termination in writing In the process of termination it is important that when the termination takes place due to poor performance the following measures have been considered and followed before making the decision of terminating the employee Setting expectations Make sure that you set the performance expectations and requirements qualifications and skills right from the beginning through a job description that is clearly shared with the employee Do not assume that the roles responsibilities and qualification requirements are clear and known or that the understanding the employee has is the same as yours supervisor manager Performance Improvement Plans and coaching Provide ongoing coaching to discuss with the employee the low performance what the problems were what solutions there might be and develop a course of action and establish commitment If you have provided ongoing coaching and training but the performance has not improved then develop a performance improvement plan with a reasonable timeline and provide the support necessary transfer demotion If the employee still shows no improvement the factory may consider discussing a transfer based on other skills that the employee shows or even a demotion if it is deemed that the employee might do better in a lower position These are last resort options that can be considered to try to work out a solution with the employee 120 documentation It is necessary to document all the process with the employee From the job description and hiring process to formal conversations and meetings performance review meeting performance improvement plans etc training and development sessions and informal conversations If no improvement is shown after all corrective actions and other measures the factory may terminate the employee Once the decision is made it is necessary that regardless of the cause of termination employees a complete handover of all outstanding matters in regard to their current responsibilities to another employee designated by the management of the factory The only exception to this would be for cases of dismissal termination without notice whereby the mere fact of the employee being present in the premises is detrimental to the work environment Handover of job duties can be accompanied by a formal handover note for positions A template for the handover note is provided in Annex In addition to the handover note it is necessary that factories prepare clearance forms to be completed by employees who leave their employment to ensure all outstanding matters are settled Some examples of matters to be settled are Appropriate handover of duties as already mentioned above Return of tools and materials for work as well as documents including IDs access cards Update data on salary and benefits Removal of letters of guarantees if available Settlement of cash advances if any Mandatory Work Certificate It is frequently misunderstood that employees are not be entitled to work certificates unless they have given an appropriate notice period While factories can withhold work certificates of an employee for failing to complete the clearance process there is little legal recourse for failing to provide the certificate for any other reason otis therefore important to address the entire process of termination of employment contract at the initial onset of the employment relationship by way of including the topic in the boarding process Once clearance process is complete it is mandatory that the HR department prepares a work certificate with details mandated by the Ethiopian Labour proclamation Please keep in mind that this certificate is mandatory and it is still necessary to provide one even if the termination was done by the employee without giving proper notice In addition to the handover and the settlement of outstanding matters it is highly recommended to conduct an exit interview with the employee leaving the factory The interview will help the factory gain valuable feedback that can help it improve aspects of the organisation understand what influences retention and based on this devise strategies to improve it and reduce turnover furthermore employees who leave factories amicably by serving the appropriate notice period remain to be ambassadors of their employer and can serve as sources of information to and regarding 121 potential candidates finally when both parties agree there might even be an opportunity for the employee to join back in the future For the exit interview it is recommended that it is conducted by a senior HR department staff to elicit as much candid information as possible If a staff from the HR department resigns it is recommended that a senior staff from another department conducts the interview to ensure confidentiality to the employee The attached exit interview form in Annex Il provides a guideline to the HR department on the type of information to be gathered and summarized on a quarterly or at least semiannual basis The report that is generated from this summary should focus on major reasons mentioned by employees for leaving their factories This would serve as on input to design appropriate retention mechanisms for the future Things to keep in mind when conducting an exit interview create a comfortable environment and create trust It is important to create a comfortable environment in which the employee feels safe enough to provide honest feedback This is however not a task achieved only during the interview If the factory does not create a culture in which employees feel comfortable sharing ideas and critical opinions without fear of punishment or retaliation then it is very unlikely that they will suddenly open up during the exit interview Provide reassurance To create trust and make the employee feel comfortable to share openly it is important to ensure that the information from the interview is shared in a way that keeps confidentiality we go in an aggregate format and reassure this to the employee Be open and listen Listen carefully to what the employee says and be mindful of not mixing your own ideas or assuming that you clearly understand what the employee is saying Ask about the positive and the negative Ask the employee about what has led to the employees decision to look for a new job and leave but do not forget to ask about what is working well too It is crucial to know what caused the employee to become open or search for new opportunities but it is also good to know what the organisation is doing well in order to ensure that those aspects are kept and fostered 122 Annex Handover Note 123 Annex lli

work environment to avoid misunderstandings that can lead to conflicts and to resolve these conflicts once they have arisen Communication is not only important inside the factories Good communication strategies have to be developed to keep a good relationship with the community government institutions involved nos that might have an interest in the Industrial Park and international organizations moreover factories have to develop effective ways of dealing with conflict as conflicts and disputes are an inevitable aspect of every organization A communication strategy helps factories to define the audiences of the different messages they want to send to be precise in their messages and to get the message across effectively A communication strategy involves defining why What is the purpose of the communication need when What is the audience that needs to be reach what What is the message that needs to be sent how what are the right channels that need to be used This chapter provides useful information to develop and improve communication in factories and ipso It is divided in 3 sections internal communication stakeholders management and conflict resolution 1. Internal Communication Internal Communications can be defined as the exchange of information and ideas within a factory with the aim of creating an atmosphere of trust mutual cooperation and respect Although the importance placed on internal communication differs from one organization to another the common goal of all internal communication can be summarized as imparting knowledge to employees about the vision mission purpose of the organization and receiving their feedback on one or more aspects of the employment relationship with the organization In the context of factories within the industrial park internal communication is even more important given the large number of employees from diverse backgrounds the possible existence of strong informal communication channels and the precedence of frequent gaps in communication that have resulted in misunderstanding and grievances Although factories may have a clear idea of what good communication in the workplace entails in theory sometimes they may be unable to identify specific habits that affect communication A clear understanding on what good and bad communication practices help Effectively executed internal factories to avoid making common mistakes communications can result in an increase in commitment trust job satisfaction and improved performance moreover good 125 internal communications contribute to an improved corporate reputation and improved business results as well as reduction of potential for misunderstanding and conflicts The correct enforcement and success of all the policies and procedures that have been identified in this manual depend on good communication If communication channels don t exist or are just formal structures that are not used if communication is not actively promoted by the top management if managers and middle managers lack effective communication skills andlor if workers do not have a voice in the factory the effective implementation of good policies is doomed to failure Setting up effective internal communication structures Factories need to set up formal and informal communication structures that can facilitate effective communication in the workplace This has to be a part of a real communication strategy plan guided by the HR department and validated by top management Some of the aspects to be considered are Communication channels There are a number of communication channels that facilitate the communication in factories Employee handbook short printed publication that contains concise information about employment relationship major policies and procedures frequently asked questions reference materials and points of contact for more information refer to Chapter The HR Policy manual Permanent Notice Board materials visual reminders for organizational values existing committees health and safety objectives and priorities Periodic Notice Board materials communicating information on upcoming events changes notices disciplinary issues where applicable result of common grievances etc are accomplished through periodic notice board materials Public Address systems live announcements to communicate immediate needs or encourage a particular behaviour among employees They can be used to provide short educational messages motivation as well as entertainment that promote organizational priorities Suggestion boxes although mainly used as a venting mechanism for grievances suggestion boxes have a much wider usage among employees of an organization They can for example be used not only as airing complaints but also as sources of suggestions to improve productivity promote health and safety and report practices They should be placed at locations that are easily accessible go entry door canteen andlor contribute to confidentiality toilet room communication is vital to any effective communication strategy and developing formal tactics to listen to employees is essential Employers can elicit fast feedback through surveys and polls about specific issues like new benefit or policy or general concerns Meetings and engagement sessions Besides the communication channels sessions should be regularly organized to ensure face to face communication develop motivation ownership and making sure that key messages are being understood by all employees 126 Period ic meetings Annual meeting A meeting held during an important milestone defined by the management of an organisation is important to communicate the yearly plan results of the previous years recognize long years of service by employees or commemorate the achievement of a particularly challenging assignment All employees are involved in attending this meeting The annual meeting is best organized by a cross functional team and may even include engagement with external stakeholders major customers community leaders regional government civic associations educational institutions key suppliers etc Quarterly Employee Engagement sessions These sessions are typically held at the level and used to communicate priorities and goals They provide ample opportunity to share results of initiatives brainstorm solutions to repeated challenges and reward achievements of employees during the quarter If applicable competitions with regard to productivity improved safety perfect attendance team work and innovation can be included in these sessions Monthly checking weekly Toolbox meetings These periodic meetings are designed for smaller teams within departments nonetheless they serve an important purpose of solving problems at the first instance and handle grievances before they become major issues managers lead these communication sessions providing feedback on performance of teams as well as individuals accepting employee concerns and disseminating tactical information which is going to be immediately used Characteristics of an effective meeting There is a chairperson who makes sure that the meeting is on track and steers the discussions to the topics in the agenda The meeting has a clear goal purpose The meeting has set starting and ending times which are respected as much as possible The meeting participants have prepared for the meeting beforehand There is a person who is in charge of during the session and of circulating the finalized document The meeting is not only informational but also methods are participatory such as negotiation and voting The meeting has a system that ensures actions sessions One condone goal setting and performance review Although a specific timeline which applies to all organisations is difficult to dictate depending on the performance management cycle of the company goal setting and performance review meetings provide a good opportunity to communicate specific and feedback to employees on an individual level The success of these communications culminates in better team performance and Incident management Whenever a serious misconduct potential or actual health and safety incident or a major change in day operation occurs it is important that organisations take the lead in communicating what actually happened and the way forward This will prevent confusion misunderstanding and negative employee relations To remain consistent and effective a specific person within each department must be delegated as the sole source of such information disseminated to employees 127 Documentation of Internal Communication Organisations have a range of options in using technology for registering and disseminating information depending on the type of information level of sensitivity of a particular means of communication as well as organisational culture Communication which has a significant impact or affects a large proportion of employees must be captured by the official stance of the organization as minutes of meetings All major decisions concerns approvals and endorsements must be documented as per the existing documentation procedures of the organization Where no such procedure exists the management of the organization should initiate one in conjunction with legal counsel A template of the meeting minute can be found in Annex of this chapter Workers participation The importance of giving a voice to workers has been highlighted in many of these guidelines chapters Involving workers leads to better results and better implementation of policies Some of the benefits of fostering workers participation are Good ideas Workers have ideas and unique insights that are innovative and useful to improve productivity and solve production challenges Work intelligently workers work more intelligently if they are well informed about the reasons and intentions of decisions Solving problems Problems can be resolved more quickly if complains are listened to and addressed when they arise Builds trust communication helps to build trust between workers and managers Prevents escalation good communication helps to prevent escalation of misunderstandings and disagreements go strikes Better decisions it improves decision making regarding important issues such as working conditions productivity and quality leadership it develops leadership ownership and motivation in workers Workers participation can involve different stages of worker involvement Factories should aim to continuously improve and develop the workers representation mechanisms to get the most benefits out of it Good communication detects problems before they can turn into a strike or accident It has a positive impact on working conditions and on solving problems quickly and efficiently First stage Information sharing workers are provided with balanced and objective information about new developments in the factory through direct assemblies meetings individual discussions and indirect notice boards flyers newsletters means Second stage consultation the factory gathers workers opinions on different topics or issues before they are made In order to collect workers views a consultation body such as a committee with representatives of management and workers should be established Third stage involvement In this stage the management actively involves the cooperation of workers in the process Workplace cooperation models such as quality 12 Sustainability Agents susan Prosper eye manual Communication and dialogue 128 circles work groups and committees are established in order to directly involve workers or their representatives Suitable topics include occupational health and safety productivity efficiency welfare etc Fourth Stage Joint decision making On this stage cooperation goes one step forwards as workers cooperate not only in topics defined by the management but they also raise topics of common interest for which joint solutions are agreed on Communication skills Communication can be simply understood as the process of using words sounds signs and behaviour to exchange information or to express ideas thoughts and feelings to other people The mere act of communicating does not guarantee successful communication Many problems can arise in the process of communication creating misunderstandings and issues that lead to less productivity accidents and a negative environment in the workplace To improve communication in the workplace it is not enough to have the proper communication channels and structures in place For them to work it is necessary to develop effective communication skills to practice effective communication The importance of communication skills in the factory effective communication Communicating effectively entails not only speaking well but also and most importantly listening well When we truly listen to others we convey interest and respect We are also able to understand better the others needs and goals which is crucial for solving problems and having good relationships at the workplace To listen well it is necessary to practice active listening and also to provide qualitative feedback to employees Active listening Spend more time listening than talking Respond to others only after they have finished speaking Do not dominate the others participate and engaged Do not what you have heard until you feel that you fully understand it Do not join with a defensive attitude good communication requires an open mind Stick to the topic being discussed Walk the listeners through your analysis and summarise your statements Giving feedback Ask for clarifying information if you don t understand a point to explain the others statements in your own words to make sure you understand what they are saying and feeling Give positive feedback to the person you are speaking the importance and usefulness of higher statements Be specific examples rather than just general comments or advice Be not focus on issues refer to what the person does rather than to what you think herthe is 13 Sustainability Agents susan prospered manual Communication and dialogue 129 Be descriptive not to describe what happened instead of evaluating its goodness badness rightness wrongness Try to completely understand what the other person means by higher statements eo Try to come to a mutual understanding 2. Duty of care Duty of care refers to an obligation to take reasonable care to protect another from all reasonably foreseeable risk of harm Employers should be aware of their legal and social responsibilities related to their Duty of Care to all their stakeholders There is a general Duty of Care on employers from a legal and corporate social responsibility perspective Factories have a duty of care to their workers which means that they should take all steps which are reasonably possible to ensure workers health safety and wellbeing Duty of care can be a key factor in building trust and reinforcing commitment to workers and can help improve employee retention boost productivity and pave the way for better employee engagement Corporate social responsibility is a business model that helps a company be socially accountable to itself its stakeholders and the public Besides the legal expectation to do so factories also have a moral and ethical duty not to cause or fail to prevent physical or psychological injury and must fulfil their responsibilities with regard to personal injury and negligence claims In light of duty of care factories have different ways of responsibilities such us Clearly defining jobs and undertaking risk assessments Ensuring a safe work environment Ensuring workers do not work excessive hours without rest Protecting workers from bullying or harassment either from colleagues or third parties Protecting workers from discrimination Providing communication channels for workers to raise concerns Consulting workers on issues which concern them Prevent risks to health Ensure that machinery is safe to use Provide adequate first aid facilities Setup emergency plans 130 Make sure that ventilation temperature lighting toilet washing and rest facilities all meet health safety and welfare requirements Check that the right work equipment is provided and is properly used and regularly maintained Provide protective clothing or equipment free of charge if risks can t be removed or adequately controlled by any other means therefore foreseeable risks to these employees must be mitigated by an employer through an integrated and strategic risk management strategy This approach must be suitable to the work context of the workers Factories employ workers coming from different catchment areas in rural surroundings of industry parks More often these workers are vulnerable to safety and security risks due to both negligence and for a simple fact that they are unaware of their surroundings Factories must demonstrate they have taken steps to educate their employees about these risks so that they are prepared to handle them should they arise Factories must then monitor the environment for potential hazards and update workers including expatriates on any developments that could become critical incidents finally employers must adequately support and assist their employees in event of a crisis or an emergency Factories can follow the following steps to set up an effectively duty of care practice for their workers 1. Assess risks Assess health safety and security risks in the locations where workers are assigned including outside the premises of the factory or travel to for work 2. Develop an integrated risk management strategy This includes both incident crisis management plan and an ongoing Duty of Care process so that the organization can effectively assume its Duty of Care obligations 3. Develop policies and procedures Develop clear Duty of Care and travel risk management policies and procedures for expatriate workers and international The management of most factories in industrial parks are comprised of employees of different nationalities from abroad Factories are responsible for the safety and security of these expatriates thus should develop guidelines and risk management procedures including but not limited to Overall security situations in Ethiopia and in the region of the its location Contact details and telephone trees of responsible personnel for safety and security of employees Telephone trees is a phone communication line that people in an organization use to quickly notify others in the event of an emergency annex ii Recommendations and instructions on how to deal with security risks both in industrial parks and outside the premises of ipso Security standard operating procedures Medical and emergency guidelines including evacuation procedures Emergency contact details Security risk matrix 4. Communicate and train workers 131 Factories need to make sure that the duty of care policies and procedures and travel risk management plan communicated throughout the organization and that workers are informed 5. Continuous Provide ongoing guidance support and assistance when workers are in safety and security risks and find themselves in unfamiliar situations 6. Control and analyze Track and analyze workers safety and security data to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of duty of care 3. stakeholders management A stakeholders is defined as anyone that can affect or is affected by what someone else is trying to achieve In the case of factories in Ethiopian ipso relevant stakeholders would be clients suppliers the immediate community and the government departments that collaborate with the IP or are influenced by its functioning the workers and the workers families Of particular importance is the impact that an IP has in the communities in which they are settled Every aspect of a communitys economy is affected by the new ip For example the new workers that arrive to the area attracted by the employment opportunities offered by the IP contribute to a high increase in the demand for transport housing and public security which in turn often leads to a rise in the prices of goods and services which the local community might find initially hard to adapt to Such developments when negative and not handled properly can easily lead to social unrest stakeholders management included the systematic identification analysis planning and implementation of actions designed to engage with stakeholders A good stakeholders management strategy can help the factories and the IPs in general to prevent conflict by establishing a good relation with the community from the very beginning In order to prevent social unrest and clashes with stakeholders such as the local community it is crucial that from the very beginning IPs have a clear strategy on how to communicate with and relate to them Such a strategy will help generate spaces of dialogue and mutual understanding which can prove to be critical not only for reaching clear agreements with the community and other stakeholders but also for preventing the escalation of conflicts and managing risks Steps of stakeholders management It is recommended that factories go through the identification of stakeholders and development of an engagement plan as a park strategy This will help to join efforts and to make sure that all factories are following the same goals Remember that the reputation of the IP affects the reputation of all individual factories both for the good and for the bad To develop an effective stakeholders management strategy it is necessary to Identify the stakeholders Stakeholders are anyone who can affect or is affected by a project or action In this case by the development settling and functioning of the factories psi 132 Understand their needs and expectations towards the industrial park For example What are the different stakeholders ideas about the ip What needs could the industrial park cover What needs could the IP generate in the community Classify stakeholders Not all stakeholders are the same A widespread way of classifying them is by considering the interest concern stakeholders have and how much they have to influence the ip matrix High power high interest ensure that they are consulted collaborated with and engaged completely Keep Manage satisfied closely High power less interest keep them satisfied but not go into details frequently Low power high interest keep Monitor Keep them informed about progress informed and changes They can be allies and help prevent issues times Low power low interest monitor their interest levels Engage them with generic communication Develop the engagement strategy Based on the understanding developed of each group of stakeholders decide the frequency and the ways in which you would like to engage them and who will be responsible for engaging each stakeholders This will be the core of your strategy and will be the base of your engagement plan Take Action and manage engagement Once the strategy is set up it is time to take action Communicating and working with stakeholders to meet their addressing issues as they occur and fostering appropriate engagement in planned activities A responsible team of people has to be defined and a schedule with activities as well as contingency plans in cases of unexpected problems Revise and repeat stakeholders management is not to be done one time only It is an operative activity that has to be revised and renewed not only to learn from previous actions but also because stakeholders change as well as their interest and power Useful principles for stakeholders engagement Check the communication preferences and if information is being understood clearly by all stakeholders This will help to avoid misunderstandings and working towards common goals Have a clear picture of who the stakeholders are their own objectives and constrains and gain their support from an early phase It is recommended that factories engage in this activity as soon or even before they establish themselves in a region Previous information on stakeholders is usually available in the Environmental and Social Impact Assessment of the ip 133 Remember that stakeholders are human and therefore their behaviour can be unpredictable or irrational Invest time and resources on planning your engagement strategy Plan with flexibility but rigorously Relationships are key in countries like ethiopian invest time in generating trust among the stakeholders and consider cultural values that are relevant to every region Make sure that those involved in managing stakeholders develop the necessary skills empathy effective communication negotiation skills active listening 14 2. Conflict management Conflict is inevitable in all working environments Having a good internal communication strategy in place and sound workplace policies and procedures established are the foundation for good workplace relations and can help a prompt and equitable settlement of labour disputes when these arise however factories have to be ready if conflicts escalated Conflict can be either constructive or destructive and its effect in the organisation will be defined by the way it is handled Conflict can lead to the establishment of better procedures fairer practices and more productivity in the factory or it can lead to increasing dissatisfaction and long periods of no production or low productivity Learning to manage conflict is an integral part of any organisation in particular in organisations with a high number of employees such as factories As the HR department is in charge of managing employee relationships the staff must have an understanding of how to handle conflict in the factory and how to respond to an escalation of conflict Principles of effective conflict resolution According to the International Labour Organisation the following principles should be followed by organisations for the effective resolution of disputes An effective system for processing workplace disputes is essential for sound labour relations and the proper functioning of an organisation The parties should use their best endeavours through discussion consultation and negotiation to resolve any disputes which may occur and must deal with each other in good faith in seeking mutually acceptable solutions to disputes They should consult each other when they anticipate that disputes may arise employers employees and their organisations should treat one another with appropriate sensitivity and respect and contribute towards a constructive working environment making genuine attempts to resolve disputes at the workplace 14 rich Professional guidance uk stakeholders engagement est edition 15 lot Code of good practice Resolution of disputes at the workplace Industrial Relations act Section 109.

The HR Scorecard Effective measurement systems encourage a clear consistent and shared view on how factories implement their strategy in each department and at each level It helps factories to focus on what is important what is happening the reasons why this is happening and to foresee what might happen in the future Relevant and good quality data is key to make strategic decisions A scorecard is a metric used in strategic management to identify and improve various internal functions of a company and their outcomes It be can used to measure and provide feedback to each department on how they are working towards the factory strategic A scorecard is a tool that provides a comprehensive measure of how the organization progresses towards the achievement of its strategic goals An HR Scorecard allows the HR Department to be able to visualize and show the value it creates in the factory Unlike dashboard the most common metrics used in the factory scorecards have a focus on strategy and longterm goals Dashboard versus Scorecard  Used for monitoring and performance  Used for performance management and measurement strategy  Based on daily metrics  Based on Key Performance Indicators metric plus target that we want to achieve Updated in real time  Updated periodically Focus on operational goals  Focus on strategic longterm goals Helps to visualize performance to  Helps to visualize a strategy identify why understand the current state something is happening and what can be done The HR scorecard is a method for the had to position itself as a strategic partner with line managers and executives The metrics help to demonstrate how HR activities impact profitability how HR is a source of competitive advantage for the factory internally an HR scorecard helps understand the big picture and ensures that everyone is moving towards the same direction What to measure In order to define the measures that will give meaningful information on the strategic role of HR in our factories the department should focus on their and overall impact on the factory operations To do so HR departments must identify Key Result Areas the fundamental areas of the outcome for which a department is accountable Examples of era for the HR department are recruitment and selection training and development performance management Key Performance Indicators quantifiable measure that gauges the performance of the department in quantitative terms kris can be grouped according to the era to which they are related Examples of ki for the had are turnover rate average time to recruit number of grievances successfully solved internally 144 It is not possible nor efficient for a factory to try to quantify all the aspects of their strategy and outcomes however this shouldn t be a reason not to measure the key dimensions of HR strategy Setting up Targets and Checking Performance After the definition of the bras and kiss factories need to set up targets for each ki selected In order to define targets factories should start by measuring the actual value that the ki has later they should define targets that are both ambitious and achievable For this historical data if available or external sources can be used to provide A target is the desired level of performance that aims to be achieved as measured by the kiss information to set up clear and achievable targets Whereas targets should be not all of them have to refer to the same timeframe For example the ki average time in training per employee is usually evaluated in a yearly basis while turnover rate is usually done monthly How to implement the HR scorecard This chapter provides a template for factories in Ethiopian IPs to track the most relevant kris for the performance of the HR department Factories can use the template as a basis to then establish their own HR scorecards that should evolve in complexity along with the development of the HR departments expertise and functions Implementing new practices in a factory can be challenging but the benefits it brings are worth the effort Some tips to facilitate the adoption and effective use of the HR Scorecard are Get the HR staff involved and train them on HR metrics Establish clear responsibilities and deadlines for each ki Take small steps start with a few kris per krav Don t over measure make sure that the investments in measuring are worth their benefit Encourage thinking beyond numbers What are the causes behind the data Be persistent on the application of the HR scorecard Develop and include in the HR scorecard the measures planned in order to reach the targets 145 HR scorecard for factories in Ethiopian IPs Absenteeism rate Turnover rate Productivity rates Retention rate of high performance Percentage of

Centralised Services in Industrial Parks A centralized service is a service that is provided to a cluster of different entities provided that they share a common interest in the service provided In the case of industrial parks centralized services refer to those that are taken out of the sphere of the individual factories to start being provided to them all as a whole by one or more providers under the same standards The development of industrial parks lips benefits investors communities and individuals in multiple ways Some of these benefits include IPs offer employment opportunities to a large number of people who usually come from impoverished areas and have limited access to jobs They foster the development of underdeveloped areas and promote balanced regional growth contributing to regional and national economic development They provide an institutional framework a physical and social infrastructure and modern services to factories giving them a competitive advantage in the country where they operate To reap these benefits however it is necessary to ensure the success of the factories part of the ipso and while factories largely determine their own success by defining their own production goals financial objectives and internal structures and by responding to their individual needs their success is also linked to the bigger framework in which they find themselves namely the ip As most of the challenges the factories face such as attracting and retaining workforce maintaining a good relationship with stakeholders and ensuring good working conditions to their employees are often challenges shared by other factories in the IP and in many cases in other IPs as well the IP can help factories tackle these challenges by centralizing social services and resources sharing the provision and management of key services that are delivered to all the workforce of an Increasing of social services as joint efforts allow to provide better quality services with lesser resources Providing a level platform of minimum social services and standards thereby helping to avoid multiple and dispatching standards in IPs Preventing social and labour standards from being entangled into the logic of 18 undo Global Assessment of Parks in Developing and Emerging countries Retrieved from union org sites default files 2017 02 2016 Unido Global Assessment of Eco Industrial Parks in Developing Countries Global RECP programme 0. edf on 148 Contributing to fostering social peace with the communities around the ip as sharing a joint strategy to manage community relationships contributes to protecting the reputation of the IP and of each factory Preventing unrest with the workforce as they receive standard social services that Enabling the factories to focus on their core business production and quality as helps to significantly reduce the time and resources that each factory would require to do so individually The structure and responsibilities for the generalization of services is to be developed by each ip It is recommended that the main management functions are under the responsibility of an association of all factory tenants investors association In the next sections a number of interventions for offering centralised services in Ethiopian IPs are introduced These interventions are intended to help IPs and factories tackle some of the most common and pressing challenges faced by both It should be highlighted however that for these interventions to be effective factories and the IP need to have a common understanding of current challenges to set clear goals and to channel efforts into joint sustainable strategies 2. Management of Stakeholders IPs have a significant impact in the communities in which they are settled Almost every aspect of a communitys economy is affected by the new ip For example one of the consequences often observed after the introduction of an ip is a change in the living conditions in the surrounding areas Attracted by the employment opportunities offered by the ip thousands of workers from both nearby and faraway regions flock into the area increasing the demand for transport housing and public security this in turn often leads to a rise in the prices of goods and services to which the local community might find initially hard to adapt Jointly identify the stakeholders Stakeholders are anyone who can affect or is affected by a project or action In this case by the development settling and functioning of the ip Understand their needs and expectations towards the industrial park Classify stakeholders Not all stakeholders are the same A widespread way of classifying them is by considering their power interest in and how they are affected by the ip eo Develop the engagement strategy Based on the understanding developed of each core of your strategy and will be the base of your communication plan more information on this topic can be found in Chapter communication 149 Some ways in which you stakeholders can be engaged are stakeholders Community forum The forum includes relevant local authorities and organisations and is steered by a professional mediator Meetings should take place regularly and at the end of each meeting there should be decisions on tangible outcomes To ensure the success of this medium it is necessary to assess and review the forums work regularly Community activities Activities such as guided visits to the ip special events at the IP can help the community to get to know the ip Venues for dialogue Venues to engage in dialogue which may be of the scale of the stakeholders community forum but can also be much smaller to share concerns and work on solutions 3. Medical Services The health of workers is inevitably linked to their productivity and workplace satisfaction Health risks at the workplace such as heat dust hazardous chemicals psychological stress and related to the workplace such as long commutes can affect the physical and psychological health of workers this in turn can lead not only to a decrease in productivity due to go more sickness days and less efficiency but also generate a general feeling of dissatisfaction among workers as they perceive the workplace to have a negative impact on their level of wellbeing To counter some of the health risks posed by the workplace and the negative consequences that can arise from those risks it is necessary to apply measures for protecting workers health Research has shown that workplace health initiatives help reduce absenteeism related to sickness by and healthcare costs for companies by Healthcare initiatives should however not be limited to improving working conditions but also to ensuring access to preventive healthcare and timely treatment Such initiatives can be taken individually by the factories but also in a centralised manner through the ip As mentioned above however having a centralised shared facility can help factories to save time and costs while still allowing them to provide high quality medical care for its workers The centralised medical centre should be adequate to the size of the IP and provide the following services Standard medical treatment and medication Preventive health services such as educational campaigns for disease prevention we go its or common illnesses among workers such as kidney disease due to dehydration reproductive health the provision of sanitary products such as sanitary pads for women and nutrition Emergency medical services including ambulance pickups and transport to nearby hospitals for situations that are beyond the capacities of the clinic First aid training for factory staff and providing ongoing advice to factory management on nutritional requirements quantity quality and frequency of meals provided to the WHO Protecting Workers health Retrieved from who sheets detail protecting workers health 150 To ensure the sound operation and effectiveness of the medical centre it is imperative that standard procedures are developed for all services provided and communicated to the management of each of the factories in the ip Factories should be well aware about the procedures to be able to clearly provide instructions to workers and to the management in charge of dispatching workers to the centre in case of illness injury or emergency and of coordinating healthcare campaigns and training Communication should however not be limited to the procedures The centre should provide regular reports on sickness and accident rates to the factories as well so that they can use them for their social auditing and other stakeholders communication purposes finally to ensure the good quality of the services strict standards and guidelines should be developed and monitored by public authorities the investor associations or a commission set up for this purpose This will help to guarantee a safe and healthy environment for the patients and keep track on the technical performance services offered effectiveness of care and the physical infrastructure of the clinic 4. Meals Workers nutrition is very important in the factory context Good nutrition levels lead to gains in productivity and worker morale prevention of incidents such as mass fainting and a reduction of sick days In the case of manual workers it is especially important that their diet satisfies their high caloric intake needs however the reality is that many workers are unable to consume enough calories to perform the strenuous work expected of them Workers often find themselves with little money by the middle of the months which makes it difficult for them to buy sufficient food In some cases workers do not count with the facilities necessary to store or cook food at home Workplace meal programmes help address some of these difficulties and prevent nutritional deficiencies and diseases such as anaemia which lead to chronic fatigue tiredness weakness difficulty concentrating on work and consequently low productivity Factories can significantly benefit from a workplace meal programmed Providing at least one meal to workers can greatly contribute not only to avoid the negative consequences of malnutrition on production but also to enhance the overall health and wellbeing of workers Unlike cash food allowances meal programmes prevent workers from spending the money to address other needs and also ensure that at least one meal consumed by workers meets nutritional needs In this way the meal programme helps enhance workers health and reduce the instances of workers experiencing health problems such as feeling weak and fainting at work As with other services mentioned previously factories can organise this service individually and provide meals to the workers in their own canteen however a centralised meal service can be beneficial for the factories as it Lowers costs Limits the amount of effort required by factory management Ensures that meals meet caloric and nutritional requirements by engaging professionals in the development of the menu The centralised meal programme can be organised in different ways One of the most uncomplicated ways however is by arranging a central kitchen that delivers the food to meal 151 rooms either for each shed or for sharing by a number of sheds in shifts This would avoid the organisational complexity of having one main canteen in which all workers in different factories within the IP go for a meal at different times and of delivering food to numerous individual factory canteens In order to have a successful meal programmed however it is absolutely mandatory to ensure that in addition to nutritious and sufficient the food provided by the canteen is safe therefore it is imperative that the meal programme includes a supervision component that entails regular and spontaneous checks to monitor hygiene condition of facilities quality of supplies and prepared food and the canteen services themselves 5. Transport Transport is an essential service that can greatly affect the quality of life of workers Lack of safe reliable and affordable public transportation systems and the long commutes from the workers houses to the IP can make transport one of the biggest challenges for workers of left the deterioration in the wellbeing of workers caused by the lack of adequate transport or exhausting commutes can result not only in higher tardiness and absenteeism rates but also ultimately in higher turnover rates To address this problem it is necessary to provide workers with a reliable transport service to commute to work Providing transport can help minimise the stress felt by workers who need to adapt to the urban lifestyle It can reduce tardiness and absenteeism as workers can rely on the factorys buses to come on time in all weather conditions It can make it easier for workers to take overtime hours when needed as they do not have to worry about availability of transport at late hours and finally it can also help protect workers by ensuring that transport meets safety As with other services factories can choose to either organise their own transport or opt for taking part in a centralised transport service at the IP level Some of the benefits that a centralised transport unit brings are It makes it easier to combine the service with vehicle maintenance shop which could ensure that factory are fully compliant with safety requirements and follow standard procedures It lowers costs through collective tendering and subcontracting process requires less effort from factory management 6. Subsidised Shops Factory workers usually have limited income and to buy goods that help them meet their most basic needs As a consequences they are often only able to buy small amounts of food and basic goods furthermore as some of them also lack the facilities at home for the safe storage of food and other items they are unable to purchase larger amounts which would potentially allow them to save money was the smaller the unit the higher the price per item lastly when IPs are developed in a region and a mass of workers arrive there it is common for prices to rise as 152 businesses speculate with the costs of goods This makes it even harder for workers to have access to good and nutritious food To tackle this problem IPs can offer food at cost or wholesale prices in fair shops This would enable workers to access affordable and good quality basic goods and thereby allow them not only to have food security but also save money In addition by ensuring that the food is of good quality fair shops could help prevent sickness among workers due to the consumption of food ultimately by increasing the wellbeing of workers through enhanced food security and increased possibilities for saving money these shops can be a big incentive for workers to stay in the factory and can make the option of working in the IP more attractive to the community Building and setting up shops and infrastructure of subsidised shops should be done by whereas the management and operation of the shops can be done in different ways Option 1. Once price of goods is fixed through thorough assessments and market analyst that involves workers an open tendering can be conducted to select retailers to occupy and operate shops Option 2. Subsidized consumer cooperatives can be contracted to provide goods and food items for fair prices To ensure that subsidised shops function correctly it is necessary to have clear and strict regulations For example limits on the amount of goods that can be sold per worker should be established in order to avoid reselling and regulations to ensure the quality of food to be offered should be developed to avoid massive illness The regulation should include not only the quota pro workers and quality assurance measures but also directions regarding keeping and replenishing stock selecting suppliers and determining sale prices 7. Training Training is a crucial part in the Ethiopian manufacturing industry Training prepares the workforce with the knowledge and skills necessary to perform well in their role Benefits of proper training was explained in more detail in Chapter 3 Employee boarding and Chapter 4 Training and development include improvements in production efficiency and decreases in absenteeism and turnover rates however factories sometimes lack the resources time skills and budget to provide relevant training to their workforce IPs can help factories with this challenge Although technical training is highly industry and factory specific training on general technical skills life skills and soft skills managerial skills are necessary for employees in all kinds of factories and can therefore be centralised in an IP training centre Through centralised training services an IP training centre would enable factories to provide training to their staff on core topics with considerably less costs and efforts It would count with skilled staff that possesses expertise not only on the different topics at hand but also on training delivery methods and adult education The centre would have structured programs and diverse material to ensure the development of relevant skills in workers supervisors and management workers staff and managers of all factories within the IP would be trained in topics such as leadership team building labour law compliance and oh among others It would be 153 located in within the IP premises and have a dedicated training office For special cases the delivery of training could be arranged in each factory Factories gain added benefit from centralized training services because preplanned training programs make it easier for factories to design developmental plans per employee Training costs decreased as factories can now send only the relevant workers to take part in specific training types Cost and effort of training acquisition process is eliminated Factories can plan operational activities and training simultaneously as the centralized training service will accommodate similar trainings in different timelines In order to create ownership and maximize the added value of the training centre design of training programs and modules should include inputs of factories management A competitive bidding and selection of training providers should be conducted for the management and operation of the training centre As beneficiaries and major players of the training program design factories are to be responsible for the cost of the training services whereby governmental organizations such as along with the tenants association can set up the training centre and infrastructure 8. Counselling Many of the workers who start working in manufacturing facilities come from rural areas Most of them are young females and it is usually the first time that they are away from their families and villages Dealing with the challenges posed by starting a new job in a new environment the factory can be stressful by itself but in many instances workers have to face difficulties related to having to adapt to a new living situation that entails not only adjusting to an urban lifestyle but also being in a new place without a social support network family members moreover even though it is often harassment and abuse are common in many factories and workers feel that they have to deal with this themselves as they are too afraid of losing their jobs or of the consequences that speaking up can have to their reputation finally it is not uncommon that factory workers are stereotyped and marginalized by the community Faced with such a cocktail of challenges workers often find it extremely difficult to deal with their new life situation and as a results quit the factories to return to their homes after a few months of work Providing counselling both about work and personal issues is a valuable tool to ease the situation of the workers and help them to deal with their daily problems Although it may not always be able to solve the problems faced by the workers it can offer much needed psychological support and thereby alleviate some of the feelings of frustration and being overwhelmed experienced by the workers This can help to increase the sense of wellbeing among workers and in this way help factories to increase retention It is highly encouraged that factories in IPs share knowledge and jointly address common needs work together towards joint solutions and develop new ways of offering better services to their workers while saving Although factories can offer counselling services on their costs own centralizing counselling services have the added benefit of allowing factories to offer qualified professional support support by professional 154 psychologists with experience in working with women and workers or vulnerable groups to the workers at reduced costs 9. Social and Environmental Standards Factories can benefit from setting up structures to share knowledge and efforts to comply with social and national laws and international standards Although this guideline itself is a tool to provide a common base and guide for factories in IPs in regards to social standards and HR processes the IP can further support factories by offering a centralised service that provides advice on how to apply regulations and standards to ensure compliance The service can also perform audits to monitor implementation and make sure that all factories are on the right track In case that factories are facing challenges in applying the certain standards or want to implement additional standards they could also request assistance from the centralised service 10. Monitoring of Centralised Services Regardless of whether it is for transport meals or any other of the services proposed monitoring and evaluation schemes have to be developed to ensure the quality of the services and guarantee transparency These schemes can be developed by an external consultant or ngo hired by the tenants association moreover in the case of hiring contractors a competitive bidding process should be developed and followed The bidding should needless to say observe the highest standards of ethics In order to guarantee a fair and transparent bidding process rules such as excluding all bidders with a history of corruption or fraudulent practices as well as those who have personal links with those preparing checking the documents or making the selection should be in place Contractors hired must have experience in offering the service and have with qualified personnel and financial capacity Clear objectives have to be given to hired contractors and formal communication channels have to be established as well as regular instances for information exchange finally calls for contractors should be done periodically every 1 or 2 years and the performance of the last contractor should be thoroughly evaluated 11. Continuous Efforts Towards Shared Benefits This annex presented only some of the services that could be centralised and shared by all factories in ipso naturally it is also possible for factories to provide these social services individually however provided that standards are followed offering these services jointly bring benefits that exceed those achieved by factories working separately Some of these benefits include increased cost effectiveness high standard levels of social benefits provided and overall a good reputation of the IP within the community For this reason it is highly encouraged that factories in IPs share knowledge and jointly address common needs work together towards joint solutions and develop new ways of offering better services to their workers while saving costs The better the whole IP performs the more competitive 155
