A Diagnostics Study on ESG In Sustainable Investments for Garment textile Leather Leather products horticulture and industries. Executive Summary ethiopian the second most populous country in african with a population of over 100 million people is the fastest growing economy in the East African region with a rapidly growing industrial landscape and a huge potential of growth in the years to come Over the last few years the country rapid economic growth has seen a slowdown largely owing to the changing political landscape further exacerbated in the face of the pandemic and the resultant global economic slump consequently there is a need for building resilience in a number of key sectors in the country In this context the principles of ESG environment social and governance integrated into industrial operations can provide a holistic and novel way of conducting business one that is profitable not only for the companies but for the country as a whole ESG principles have demonstrated their effectiveness globally in direct and measurable means such as greater transparency reduced impact on the environment etc and also through indirect results greater stability and resilience better performance in volatile market conditions etc Many countries including several emerging economies are demonstrating a paradigm shift through a growing commitment towards sustainable financing a strong focus towards investment ESG has been recognized as a strategy for accomplishing this transformation ESG principles are also to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and can significantly contribute to the achievement of the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals In ethiopian the support advisory and networking opportunities provided by the Belt and Road Initiative Sustainable Investment Promotion have created an enabling environment for sustainable investment practices Garment and textile horticulture leather and leather products including industries are some of the key export oriented light manufacturing industries in ethiopian These industries are of great importance for both domestic and foreign investors including the countries along the Belt and road This study presents the results of an exercise dedicated to formulating an ESG framework for the aforementioned industry sectors in ethiopian based on both global experience and good practices as well as local experiences sustainability in with The study analyzed a wide range of international ESG framework concluding that there are certain key features common to the most widely used international framework mission statement and context ESG integration process Key Performance Indicators and of the framework The key purpose of this assignment was to adopt lessons from such existing international framework to ethiopian particularly for the four selected industry sectors The study also highlights that ESG framework are not always comprehensive and have their limitations A number of kiss especially in the Governance and Social categories are not easily quantifiable and are therefore harder to report and evaluate Any ki that relies on self reporting could be subject to corporate bias and credibility issues which could give a skewed representation of the performance of the entity in question framework that have been created for adoption by the global business community could face roadblocks in implementation in different geographical locations due to variations in regulations business and political climate and various other external factors Bearing in mind these limitations the ESG framework for selected Ethiopian industry sectors developed under this project has been designed to be simple and intuitive in its macroscopic elements while also remaining deep enough in its ability to measure challenges and progress The framework has four key components Foundational elements underlying considerations and qualities of the framework that provide a sound basis for the rest of the features This includes the key considerations that the framework is built around the design of the framework which proposes a three phase approach to framework implementation and the reliability of the framework Performance standards measurable indicators under and that can be quantified compared and assessed Assessment system the mechanism by which the indicators are quantified and its inherent variables such as The proposed assessment system assigns a uniform scoring at a question level which is averaged out and expressed as a percentage score for the At the level a corresponding to priority between low priority and high priority is assigned The score of the is the product of the percentage score and the This score is then aggregate to the indicator and category levels Implementation framework suggestions on how the framework can be and the key interventions needed to support the same This section provides insight on the institutional setup and implementation and monitoring protocol that needs to be established in order to effectively deploy the framework These components have been summarized in the

where 18 companies were selected and then assessed based on the developed draft framework The objective of the consultations with these companies across the four industrial focus sectors has been twofold 1. To understand where companies stand in terms of sustainability of their operations and what challenges they face and the sustainability scenario of the and the government policy framework pertaining to the sector 2. To test the draft ESG Framework developed for Ethiopia as described in Chapter 4 against the reality of companies on the ground and to refine the draft by reflecting those local realities in the final ESG framework The criteria for the selection of case study companies included a balance between the four industrial focus sectors the geographic regions within the country companies located within industrial parks and outside industrial parks companies owned by foreign and local investors and larger and smaller companies in terms of revenue and number of employees The 18 case study companies included four companies from the textile and garment industry five from the leather and leather product industry four from the horticulture industry four from the industry and one from the sugar and industry On the application of the framework assessment system to the case studies the following results have been obtained score in was Garment Textile Leather Leather Products including super to ago Governance score Social score environmental score Based on the results of the assessment and the experience of conducting the case studies the following observations have been made Thanks to strong labor policies there is a better understanding of social concerns in comparison to governance or environmental concerns In allyou sectors surveyed the businesses interviewed demonstrated some level of efforts towards sustainability Understanding of sustainability is limited especially in domestic companies when compared to foreign companies There are many examples of innovation and investment in sustainability but they are not curated as they were evolved organically to either fulfil a need or through altruistic endeavors There is a general sense of reluctance towards public The sector including sugar and industries emerged as the best performer in all three categories go so end while the Leather Leather Products sector has been seen lagging across the categories other results include of the responding companies have established dedicated departments or have hired dedicated personnel overseeing ESG aspects Almost all companies interviewed have some sort of ESG policy in place Companies with strong foreign shareholder or government involvement have formal EMS in place Most of the interviewed companies have sector specific standards in place Companies highlighted that having ESG in place will help them in their international market expansion Full compliance with Ethiopian labor laws transparency in company management style as well as working closely with trade unions have been highlighted as important aspect to avoid corruption and increase transparency Most companies undertake regular audits in the financial social environmental water or energy areas 10 Policy Does your company have any of the following policies Equal Opportunities Policy Health and Safety Policy Environmental Policy Social Responsibility Policy Sustainability Policy Garment Textile horticulture Leather Leather Products Sugar Sector Social All 18 companies interviewed strictly follow the country labor standards by for example providing written contracts to their employees allowing for collective bargaining and paying overtime 11 companies interviewed pay their employees equal to or more than the local average salary for their respective roles in the company Companies have indicated that they provide adequate Personal Protective Equipment upper to their employees 14 companies have a nominated health and safety representative andlor expert in place 16 companies have an active Corporate Social Responsibility program including dedicated local improvement projects in their respective communities Environment overall of the case study companies have taken one or multiple actions in the last three years to increase energy efficiency of companies have increased the recycling of polluted water for reuse in their operations All case study companies have waste management systems in place but in some industries up to of raw materials goes to waste On average case study companies procure about of their supplies locally This varies significantly between industries with the leather and leather product industry having with the highest average of local procurement and horticulture with only the lowest Only one of the case study companies is conducting periodic calculations of its carbon footprints None of the case study companies considered their operations as having any adverse impact on local biodiversity 11 of case study companies that have taken action on energy efficiency by activity Replacement of old machines 38 Use of energy recovery processes 38 Use of energy efficient controls The experience from the field shows a motivated if inconsistent policy and practice landscape with encouraging examples of innovation and good practices Building on the observations the following overarching recommendations have been noted There is potential to adapt the framework to the needs of context This not only includes any adaptation but also the development of a lite framework to match expectations from the ground While amplification of the framework is not recommended as a permanent measure it is important to remember that the current understanding of ESG and sustainability in general is largely limited and thus some indicators and are unlikely to see meaningful responses in near future Implementation of the framework requires action across various key aspects The project consortium has identified seven key areas where action needs to be mobilized in order to successfully execute the framework Aspects such as institutional setup implementation and monitoring had been built into the fabric of the framework while capacity building legislative support and technology development came out as important considerations from the case studies Financing mechanisms stakeholders engagement are other areas of interest based on the knowledge and expertise of the consortium Many decisions relating to the framework still need to be taken This project provides a view towards designing a mechanism for ensuring investments In this context the framework acts as a potential bridge between global examples and ground reality The process of implementation however requires an even deeper analysis that is conducted in consultation with a diverse group of stakeholders In this context the framework in its current form is the necessary foundation onto which the actual rules of engagement for sustainable investments need to be built This includes discussions on 12 roles and responsibilities of key players necessary capacity development for all relevant stakeholders terms of reference for different parties involved development and approval of necessary elements financing mechanism institutional setup and the roadmap for implementation The scope of this study was fairly limited A robust pilot phase voluntary compliance is necessary to not only adequately calibrate the framework but to also set ethiopian specific benchmarks for the performance standards While building the ecosystem for investments is likely to take a few years the first step in the implementation of the framework should be a pilot study covering a realistic period of years Participation in the pilot needs to be a representative sample for each of the sectors considered LEGISLATIVE SUPPORT CAPACITY BUILDING INSTITUTIONAL SETUP IMPLEMENTATION MONITORING TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT FINANCING stakeholders ENGAGEMENT These recommendations have been developed into concrete steps that can be implemented over the next few years presented in chapter 6 of this report 13 1 Background Ethiopia is the second most populous country in african with a population of 109 million people It is the fastest growing economy in the East African region driven by the nations strong commitment to the development of the industrial sector in the past decades Ethiopia aims to become country by 2025. Without doubt ethiopian economic landscape is dynamic and rapidly growing with vast potential for further progress in the coming years however in the last years this rapid expansion has lost pace due to factors such as a changing political scenario causing a synchronization between federal and regional economic objectives and policies ethiopians gap growth rate has witnessed a downward trend going from in 2015 to a significant low of in 2018 which marginally improved to in 2019. This problem has been exacerbated by the current pandemic situation that has severely affected economies all around the world Since the first case of was registered in Ethiopia in the middle of March there have been wide ranging detrimental effects of the pandemic on ethiopians economy Modelling work by the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa predicts that the gap growth might be reduced by 1.2 with a rebound in 2021 set to see a modest growth rate On the industrial level a contraction in exports of goods is predicted however at the end of July the Ethiopian government announced that job losses have not been as severe as initially expected with jobs lost thus far Companies all over the world have been struggling to cope with all the negative that the pandemic has brought with it aside from the obvious health concerns Along with the crippling loss of revenue companies are also experiencing breakdowns in corporate structure uncertainty in decision making and serious loss of human capital however there is evidence that certain companies that have enshrined the principles of ESG in their workflow seem to be coping with this shock much better than those that have not 1.1 ESG and its benefits ESG refers to the environmental Social and Governance considerations by corporate entities to ensure that they minimize the negative impact of their activities on the environment and the communities they operate in as well as the society as a whole These principles also ensure that companies are able to grow in a sustainable manner and develop resilience to acute shocks such as or any other national or international emergencies that would otherwise make them extremely vulnerable Investors consider ESG principles and metrics to ensure that their investments are sustainable Examples of such parameters are labor protection and welfare pollution control transparent accounting stakeholders engagement etc There are multiple international framework which aid in the of ESG principles in various sectors of the economy These framework are explained further in Chapter 3 of this report ESG integration has benefits for businesses Those who have invested in human capital management have managed to achieve better financial performance and resilience in contrast to those who have not Companies that adopted good governing practices seem to be ahead of the curve and have been able to soften the blow of the pandemic Companies with agile and supply chains and business structures have circumnavigated the widespread disruptions caused in supply chains due to transport restrictions For instance while other airline companies in Africa were struggling to cope with the pandemic and its challenges Ethiopian Airlines managed to soften the negative impact and recoup a large part of its revenue through quick decision making and diversification into cargo transportation From these and many such examples it is evident that companies which have adopted ESG strategies have been able to better cope with the various predicaments brought about by the pandemic moreover in a recent Ernst and Young study of the respondents have claimed that ESG principles must be integrated into stimulus packages designed to help economies recover from the pandemic Investors and financial institutions are considering this period to be a significant opportunity to increase focus on edge Resilience to such acute shocks is not the only advantage of the use of ESG principles By following recommended practices in the three areas of environment social and governance companies have seen marked improvements in climate resilience community engagement working conditions and labor benefits and decision making among others These overall improvements have also led to tangible financial benefits In a global survey of 475 financial institutions conducted in of the respondents said that adoption of ESG strategies has led to a significant improvement in returns consequently ESG principles are now also being considered by many investors while making their portfolio decisions In the same survey it was found that of the investors in Europe and of the investors in usa have of their investments with ESG allocations nasal recently completed a review of the companies featured in the 2019 ESG Rankings by sci It has been observed that those ranked A and above exhibited less risk when compared to the lower ranked companies that displayed greater risk It is clear from these numbers that the leaders in the sci rankings have achieved higher returns and experienced lower volatility The leaders have also proven to be less susceptible to negative outlier events such as couid 19.10 Based on the above presented data it is clear that ESG strategies are now becoming more and more normal and economically beneficial companies investors legislators and 5 international funding organizations are increasingly incorporating ESG principles in all areas of work This trend showcases a shift in the mindset of stakeholders and corporations on a global scale and it is seen as a right thing to do for business and society The future of business lies in sustainability and it is important not to be left behind in this regard At the forefront of sustainable business and investment are the ideals and principles laid out in the various ESG framework that have been published in the past few years 1.2 The Belt and Road Investment Promotion program Recognising the importance and relevance of ESG principles along with the immense potential for growth and sustainable development that they bring along Ethiopia has launched the Sustainable Investment Promotion sip program under the Belt and Road Initiative The program is supported by the UN Peace and Development Trust Fund in partnership with the Ethiopian Investment commission the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of china the Chinese Embassy in ethiopian Chamber of Commerce and enterprises a BRI few Figure Key tenets of the BRI The advantage of the program is that it enables to leverage investment opportunities which can lead to development of human resources institutional capacity building and the unlocking of ethiopian vast potential as a nation all while ensuring that the development is occurring in a sustainable manner specifically in alignment with the sags Under the brig SIP program this report provides an ESG Framework for ethiopian garment and textile horticulture leather and leather products and including industries as well as firsthand insights from consultations with 18 case study companies in Ethiopia on the development and implementation of such a framework Sustainable Investments in Ethiopian Industries In the last two decades Ethiopia has pursued a number of growth and programs with specific focus on policies This commitment to sustainability is not new in ethiopian indeed the Constitution itself provides for a right to sustainable development and a right to a clean and healthy environment The country has implemented various plans and programs fostering sustainable development since the and adopted its national Green Economy Strategy in 2011. This dedication to socioeconomic development and environmental protection was further crystallized through the integration of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its sags in national policies and programs 2.1 ethiopian sustainability commitment The intention of delivering on the right to sustainable development has a long history The State launched the Environmental Policy of Ethiopia the even in 1997 to broadly outline the policy framework for new environmental law and practice The eyes overall policy goal is to improve and enhance the health and quality of life of all Ethiopians and to promote sustainable social and economic development through the sound management and use of natural human made and cultural resources and the environment as a whole so as to meet the needs of the present generation without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs Ethiopia also adopted the Environmental Impact Assessment heian Proclamation in recognizing the value of las in harmonizing and integrating environmental economic cultural and social considerations into a process in a manner that promotes sustainable development In line with its overall and specific policy objectives the eye provides a set of Key Guiding principles including every person s right to live in a healthy environment the principles of sustainable development and public participation the principles of integration prevention precautions equity conservation eat and polluter pays principle Ethiopia is also a signatory to international environmental agreements derived from the 1992 Earth summit the Rio Conventions on biodiversity and Climate change These agreements have helped guide the national legislation towards sustainable development Much like the linkage between the mugs and gap Ethiopia has integrated the sags with in its Second Five Year Growth and Transformation Plan gap ill spanning the period thus taking a national ownership of its development obligation integrated national development plan tasked with the effective coordination and implementation of the sags The sags were integrated with ten of the priority areas of the gap Il with their targets being merged with gap it s targets in macro economy economic development infrastructure development social development democratic systems development and development ethiopian recently adopted Homegrown Economic Reform Agenda has the main goal to overcome structural challenges of the economy and it is an essential element of the Governments longterm vision providing an enabling environment for establishing the private sector as the engine of economic growth for a economy The Reform Agenda builds on the significant socioeconomic progress that Ethiopia has registered in the past while also addressing the persistent gaps that still exist today s Our reform agenda aims to overcome the aforementioned challenges through comprehensive and set of measures Address institutional and market pectoral failures reforms Figure Reforms outlined in the perspective plan source Prime Minister office Ethiopia 2019.

The sector s key objective is to bring about the structural transformation of the nations economy and create thousands of jobs Ethiopia is providing attractive incentive packages for investments in this sector including preferential tax rates and importation of raw materials machinery and equipment for manufacturers as well as an overall conducive business environment through the establishment of dedicated art industrial parks A growing number of domestic and multinational companies are becoming part of ethiopian textile and garment value chains making the country a part of the global value chain Big sourcing and buying companies such as him palmar and IKEA are now buying from Ethiopian manufacturers This has turned Ethiopia into one of the leading textile and apparel hubs of african which attracts the sector s most FDI in the region and increasingly engages global brands retailers and suppliers today 212 textile and garment companies are operating in ethiopian with investments from a variety of countries in particular from china indian and the United states Out of these 212 companies about 118 are small and local companies and 94 are medium to foreign companies In the sector exported goods worth over us 80 million to European markets alone Horticulture sector In the last ten years ethiopian horticulture sector has grown rapidly to become the fourth biggest foreign currency earner of the country currently there are around 126 investments in Ethiopia in the export of flowers fruits vegetables and herbs Farm org system files official document WIR2020 Regional edf academia .

Ethiopia The horticulture sector employs about workers and generated us 307 million in the fiscal years Leather and Leather Products sector Ethiopia possesses one of the worlds largest livestock populations providing ample opportunity for the development of the leather industry in the country however ethiopian leather industry has not yet used its potential due to lack of efficient and coordinated supply of raw hides skins and other production inputs In the past years different policies with regard to leather exports and value addition have tried to implement more efficiency into the sector According to the Ethiopian Leather Industry Development institute currently there are 26 local and 10 foreign tanner s with production capacities generating about us 70 million export revenue In addition to that there are 16 local and 3 foreign owned footwear companies operating in the leather sector 4 foreign glove makers sending gloves to international markets and 30 leather goods and leather garments that are being manufactured in ethiopian sector Ethiopia aims to increase its capacity through the creation of four dedicated Integrated Parks officially the four ships will represent us 1.5 billion in investments 400 potential business opportunities and creation of jobs on the long run The sector shall attract companies that export agricultural products as well as those producing products for domestic consumption Major agriculture processing potential in Ethiopia include in cattle fattening and processing chicken production and processing livestock feed manufacturing food production we go pasta biscuits sesame processing we go soybean crushing we go soybean oil and feed sugar production and processing juice and dairy manufacturing With significant changes since 2019 in the importation process of machinery s and the privatization of the sugar processing companies the overall performance of the sector is expected to grow rapidly in the coming years Each of these sectors with a significant potential of growth in the coming years could multiply its opportunities and subsequent benefits by integrating ESG principles within its business operations International ESG framework The principles of ESG are rooted in socially responsible investment practices which began in the wherein investors were first seen to apply a negative screening approach to their decisions For example some investors excluded stocks of industries which were involved in activities such as tobacco production or involvement in the South African apartheid regime from their portfolios In present times these ethics and selections still remain an integral part of investment decisions but the considerations have now broadened and include the areas of environmental and social responsibility and good governance practices Many investors are looking to incorporate ESG factors into their investment process alongside traditional financial analysis The concept of ESG was crystallized in through the development of a report on the Principles for Responsible Investment The United Nations PRI is now an organization of signatories who are dedicated to the promotion of ESG principles and strategies in investment decision making At the time 63 signatories composed of asset owners asset managers and service providers signed on to incorporating ESG principles in their decision making process The total assets under management was valued at us 6.5 trillion As of October PRI has seen an incredible growth was shown in Figure and now comprises 3038 signatories with total Assets Under Management valued at us 103.4 trillion 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2007 2018 2019 2020 Assets under management fuss trillion is AD am sus trillion we

relevant tool to evaluate the overall performance of a company with axes of assessment which go above and beyond traditional financial reporting There are a number of ESG framework designed for various contents and stakeholders The figure given below provides a list of some of the most widely used framework in the world currently A ENVIRONMENTAL International framework and reports reviewed

Framework London Stock Exchange Mercer Investment Framework Guidelines Group ESG Reporting for Sustainable Growth Guidelines Figure International framework and reports reviewed for this study 3.1 Key features of ESG framework Since ESG framework are developed keeping in mind varied contents and target stakeholders it is difficult to arrive at a one size fits all template for the creation of new framework however after reviewing multiple framework it can be concluded that there are certain key features which are common to the most widely used international framework These elements are delineated below Mission statement and context A mission statement intends to represent the scope of application of a framework and the transformative impact it intends to achieve All elements of a framework are designed to meet this mission and all signatories of a framework are expected to align themselves with the same For instance the World Bank es framework begins with a mention of the World Banks 23 commitment to environmental sustainability recognizing this as an essential in a world of finite natural resources equally social development and inclusion are critical for all of the World Banks development interventions and for achieving sustainable development similarly the International Finance Corporation mentions in its ESG framework if s Sustainability Framework articulates the Corporation s strategic commitment to sustainable development and is an integral part of ifs approach to risk management The Policy on Environmental and Social Sustainability describes if s commitments roles and responsibilities related to environmental and social sustainability ifs Access to Information Policy reflects ifs commitment to transparency and good governance on its operations and outlines the Corporations institutional disclosure obligations regarding its investment and advisory services The sci framework which is an framework rather than a document that lists out lender requirements operates a bit differently The focus is on resource scarcity governance standards global workforce management and evolving regulatory landscapes The sci ESG ratings take a risks and opportunities approach and focus on the negative that are generated by an industry and also on the issues that are currently affecting an industry which can later turn into opportunities that a company may work on solving and capitalize on ESG integration process This element outlines the protocol for incorporating the principles laid out in the framework into the business operations and the proposed workflow of the target implementing organizations Through extensive literature review it has been found that the framework can be of various types as outlined below Some framework pose requirements that are mandatory and must be complied with by all the action takers that are under the jurisdiction of the framework For instance under the guidance of the World Bank es framework every project funded by the World Bank must be subject to a thorough environmental and social assessment The proprietor of a World Bank funded project is referred to as the borrower The Borrower must mandatory evaluate environmental and social risks associated with the project and take appropriate steps to manage and mitigate the risks The Borrower must also agree upon an Environmental and Social Commitment Plan which will set out material measures and actions required for the project to remain consistent with the requirements of the framework set out by the World bank Other framework comprise of recommendations which are purely voluntary and are not mandatory for those economic entities that are using the framework for their sustainability related reporting and decision making For example the Task Force on Financial Disclosures recommend providing financial disclosures in their mainstream annual financial filings This ensures that the disclosures are subject to internal governance processes It is also recommended that these disclosures are 24 made in reports that are issued at least annually widely distributed and available to investors and the general public A third type of framework is designed to function as indexes or rankings of economic entities based on their overall sustainability For instance the Dow Jones Sustainability Index is a ranking index which is based on the analysis of corporate economic environmental and social performance assessing issues such as corporate governance risk management branding climate change mitigation supply chain standards and labor practices Index components are based on market capitalization and most main indexes are reviewed quarterly It is important to note that each framework adopts only one of the above modes of operation Key performance indicators This is one of the most important elements of any framework This section outlines the key aspects and parameters that are to be considered or reported under all three areas of environment Social and governance Performance will be evaluated against these indicators and will aid in further decision making based on the results obtained upon the application of the framework A comparative study of ten widely used ESG framework including sci Global Reporting Initiative among other reveals Key Performance Indicators under the categories of and which are commonly considered and have been mentioned in multiple framework These ki s and their frequency of use how many of the ten framework mention the kid are given below Table Frequency of indicator categories across ESG framework Governance ki ESG Framework Frequency Compensation Policy ESG Reporting Standards Board Level Oversight ESG Governance Policy Governance Risk Assessment Social ki ESG

all the actions that must be taken to ensure that the kris are measured and reported A protocol is also outlined for performance monitoring and any subsequent mitigation and management actions that need to be taken in order to ensure that the activities of the entity in question are satisfactory and within the boundaries set by the framework In the case of the World Bank es framework due diligence is completed before the start of a project to evaluate the environmental risks opportunities and impacts of the project The Borrower also must make a complete evaluation of the same and World Bank ensure that the esp is designed and all risk activities carried out according to the time frame that is satisfactory to the bank On the other hands told recommendations are less binding This framework requires voluntary reporting of climate related information on part of the company in question This can include various internal environmental and sustainability audits along with any audits The sci Ratings methodology involves the collection of data by sci a The sci considers 37 key performance indicators and assigns weights to these indicators based on how relevant they are to a particular industrial sector These indicators and weights are reviewed at the end of every calendar years Based on the performance of a company against these weighted indicators a company is assigned a score on a scale of based on which letter grading is then assigned 3.2 Limitations of ESG framework ESG framework are not always comprehensive and have their limitations There are a number of difficulties encountered in the creation of framework evaluation of kris and of the framework recommendations For instance a number of kiss especially in the Governance and Social categories are not easily quantifiable and are therefore harder to report and evaluate Any ki that relies on could be subject to corporate bias and credibility issues which could give a skewed representation of the performance of the entity in question framework that have been created for adoption by the global business community could face roadblocks in implementation in different geographical locations due to variations in regulations business and political climate and various other external factors 27 4 Designing an ESG framework for selected Ethiopian industries ethiopian as a developing country looking to build and bolster its industrial sector is seeing a significant influx of foreign investments At the same time Ethiopian exports are seeing growing markets in developed parts of the world such as Europe and North american Both these trends require Ethiopian industries to operate at a formidable standard of quality At the same time the Government of Ethiopia has enshrined sustainability into the very fabric of economic growth and development by releasing strategic documents and policies that show commitment to a green economy In this context an ESG framework can act as a bridge to a future that is founded on sustainable development ESG has seen a variety of different interpretations and implementation around the world Due to the wide nature of the concept there is a great opportunity to develop a framework that closely reflects the context within which it will be implemented This chapter summarizes the framework that was developed under this project its tenets and proposed mechanisms for implementation 4.1 Objectives of the ESG framework The objective of such a framework should be to define pragmatic yet ambitious goals relating to the and verticals at a company level and track the progress of these companies towards achieving these goals ESG framework can have a transformative impact on how a country performs in terms of its national development goals the sags and the Paris agreement A robust framework should also support the vision for policy development and implementation at the national and pectoral levels The proposed ESG Framework has also considered the need for being a reliable to other sectors be intuitive and easily and ca a supporting backbone for domestic and foreign investments rather than simply an additional layer of efforts finally the ESG Framework is conscious of the specific industry sector within which it is being applied and provides corresponding guidance to its users on how continuous improvements can be achieved 4.2 Designing and developing the ESG Framework The ESG Framework for select Ethiopian industrial sectors developed under this project has been designed to be simple and intuitive in its macroscopic elements while also remaining deep enough in its ability to measure progress The framework has four key components that it is built on Foundational elements which dictate the scope of the framework and how it can be applied 28 Performance standards which define the actual measurable attributes that the framework seeks to track Assessment system which aims to quantify these performance

headings Effective ESG strategies require efforts across each of these considerations It is particularly important to recognize Governance as a central piece of the framework as it leads to the of efforts under Social Environment as well and is often overlooked in conventional sustainability programs The framework has broken the key considerations to specific indicators which have been further developed into particular This granular approach provides a blueprint for sustainability strategies that companies will need to prepared in implementation of the framework Figure 6 describes the key considerations that were identified for the framework Under governance the key considerations largely aim to crystallize the interest towards sustainability at a firm level This is done by examining commitments such as mission statements and vision documents to efforts in managing sustainability This commitment is further bolstered by the presence of tangible steps taken towards a culture of ESG knowhow ethical operations and investing in sustainability Under social it is important to recognize two areas of interest internal social development in the form of policies and infrastructure and responsive health safety processes and external social impact on consumers and the larger community as a whole The category of Environment covers the inputs and outputs of the industrial processes by examining the usage of resources including raw materials energy water etc efforts towards increasing efficiency in the same both within and the value chain and management of the impact of the company operations in the form of waste and pollution as well as long term impacts such as climate and 30 Commitment to ESG across all level Investment in sustainability oO Capacity development in ESG Ethics

described in the previous chapter ESG framework vary as per applications Many development institutes indeed some of the first approaches applied under ESG framework employed a mandatory design intended to ensure a certain minimal level of sustainability in the respective companies Many agencies and collective have evolved voluntary schemes that take a similar approach while participation into the scheme is not mandated a stringent monitoring protocol is implemented as opposed to a more relaxed voluntary one competitive indices or rankings have also been on the rise bringing with them a focus on frequent audits and measuring performance as response to volatile situations A single ESG framework usually applies only one type of design voluntary compliance driven or competitive index however in this particular ESG framework these three types have been envisioned as three integrated steps of ethiopian growing focus on aligning economic development to sustainability priorities demonstrates a high potential for growth in sustainable business practices Keeping this in 31 mind it is recommended that the Ethiopian industrial sector takes advantage of the global learning on ESG by applying a staggered approach to the same In this context a multi step for phase implementation plan was shown in Figure 7 below is recommended This hybrid approach will implement three different designs of the framework sequentially applying the lessons from the preceding steps into the design of the subsequent ones It should be noted however that the core of the framework particularly the performance standards are not changing rather the requirements applied on industries and the rigidity of is evolving as the capacity to deliver on sustainable practices develops The three steps are described below 1. Voluntary compliance Companies operating in the target sectors can be invited to participate in a voluntary scheme for ESG compliance as a pilot project The aim of this project would be to conceptualize and calibrate a larger ESG plan For this voluntary compliance scheme certain minimum standards as well as more ambitious targets could be set with a total project duration of about years A exercise for the participating companies would be carried out within the first quarter of the scheme launch with and yearly audits The experience of implementation and the results at the end of the project period can be used to prepare a mandatory ESG compliance scheme In order to attract participants this scheme could be linked to fiscal incentives that can be availed by the company and potentially its investors This would be especially important for local companies who might need the support of an external fund or program to meet the costs of running such a scheme Providing certification of performance improvement could also be explored as they would provide a testament for high quality performance and operations thus significantly improving reputation and perspectives on the company 2. development greening the baseline Once suitable of ESG compliance are available in an industry sector the rest of it could be brought up to a minimum uniform level of sustainable business practices It is hence necessary to implement a compliance driven development program by having a binding legislation that demands the implementation of certain key aspects of edge including but not limited to a Company level and sector level strategy plans that cover aspects such as capacity development investment into sustainability and adoption of green programs and practices be Labor plans programs and practices that enshrine all relevant existing decrees along with adequate his guidelines and training manuals ca Appropriate resources waste and pollution monitoring processes that meet the standards set for industries by the environment Forestry and Climate Change Commission The intention of this stage is to create a greener baseline for all subsequent developments in the sector A uniform sector specific target needs to be set based on consultations with industry unions nice motif and other important stakeholders Stringent monitoring protocols that require submission of annual sustainability performance review plans featuring third party audits is critical to ensure that this baseline is effectively developed 32 over a period of years Such a program will also help demonstrate to foreign investors the forom Competitive Index participation sustainable nature of business assured in ethiopian Compliance driven development Voluntary compliance Pilot effort towards ESG Mandatory minimum longterm strategy for Help drive sustainability standards to ensuring commitment to of global standards be met by all companies in sustainability Will provide the a sector Potentially developing a foundation for Relative growth in homegrown rating performance over previous system that is linked development efforts year on a globally Limited scope interns of Pragmatic and achievable renowned standard sectors and number of goal setting participants Intermediate step towards building sustainability into industries Figure A staggered approach to ESG 3. Competitive index participation a marketplace for A longer term plan could be to invite existing global sustainability indices to integrate with a homegrown one in consultation with international agencies and also encourage companies to compete with regards to edge A competitive system encourages innovation and brings design thinking to matters relating to sustainability Ratings are also a good means to demonstrate that the quality and rigor of Ethiopian businesses are at par with the international best performers reliability reliability of the framework in different sectors without the loss of either meaning or value is a crucial design element that has been built into the framework Given that this project addresses sustainability of investments in selected sectors and that the notion of ESG itself could have a far larger scope it was deemed important to build the macroscopic elements as largely sector neutral As demonstrated by the key considerations presented above the framework seeks to encapsulate a range of information from each company and not a specific data point They can thus be applied to other sectors without much loss of meaning This enables easy replication of the framework into new sectors without significant redesign On the 33 other hands if adequate information is not captured by the framework the true performance of a company cannot be adequately determined For this reason the performance standards have been developed in a manner that at a the framework is able to gather relevant information while at a the criteria for comparison remain common At this point it is also important to acknowledge that while all sectors may have comparable criteria for sustainability their individual contribution may and in some cases should vary from sector to sector This is actualize by developing a performance standard assessment system which allocated differential scoring at both criteria and a category level This system is explained in further detail later in the chapter Performance standards Performance standards are and measurable forms of key considerations designed to be able to capture vital information These standards have two main purposes to establish granular targets for every key consideration and to track growths and improvements in a company at a level These performance standards have been designed based on the experience of the project consortium literature review and expert engagements While each performance standard can be used as an indicator they can also be broken into Performance standards are common across sectors while their components are wherever possible This allows for an easy comparison across different companies and industry types Performance standards developed for the project are given below Sustainability Commitment Sustainability Expertise Sustainability in Operations Mission Statement Employee Training Supply Chain Corporate Policies Dedicated Experts Resources Product Design Management Systems Code of Ethics Transparency Economy Audits Job Creation Public Disclosure of Audits Profits Innovation red in the subsequent subchapter these standards will be further into a

Efficiency Figure Performance standards indicators and considered under the ESG Framework 35 The list of indicators considered under the ESG Framework for Ethiopia is substantially wider than that of most framework This has been done keeping in mind the expectations to use this framework as a foundation for sustainable investments in the concerned sectors As a exercise with only and generic indicators is sure to leave out essential information on a company current and expected efforts towards sustainability the list of performance standards given above provide an almost depth thus building a more robust and informed baseline The drawback of such a detailed list is that the key indicators considered 7 and 8 under go and respectively and their numerous components collectively present a rather complex assessment To mitigate this concern the system of scoring evolved for the framework allows users to generate category wise scores This assessment system is explained below Assessment system The framework intends to balance the complexity brought by having a detailed set of indicators with the clarity and of single value totals In other words the main challenge for the assessment system has been to ensure that total scores could be generated while taking into account the differences in priorities of indicators and For this reason the framework assumes that all questions are equally relevant The assessment system applies an additive approach to the calculations first every question is scored on a scale of where 0 is awarded to the least desirable responses 1 to the most desirable response while fraction scores such as 0.5 and 0.75 are awarded to answers with intermediate desirability The score of a is the average score of its questions expressed as a percentage thus if a has three questions with the scores of 0 and the score of the is or second at the level a is assigned that can vary between weighed as 1 are low priority while those weighed as 3 are high priority 0 is given to deemed irrelevant to the analysis finally scores for higher levels are simply the sum of their components so the score of an indicator is the sum of score of the similarly at the category level the score is the sum of score of all indicators At the category level the framework recommends expressing the score as a percentage to enable comparison across contents was the absolute totals may vary from application to application The calculation methodology is represented in Figure 9. 37 This assumption was put in place to ensure that indicators with more questions do not automatically have higher shares of scores A previous iteration of the framework applied two levels of at a question level and at a level Disproportionate skewing in favor of large question sets was observed due to which changes at question or levels had little to no impact on the totals at indicator and category level Due to this nature a single level of was preferred Further versions of framework especially atomized ones could consider such multi again This option could be used to develop a lite version of the framework if needed where certain are not assessed 36 ve CATEGORY INDICATOR LEVEL A 4 LEVEL LEVEL QUESTIONS Category score indicator scores Indicator score 3 sub Weight is assigned to indicator scores between Question is scored between including fractions score average question score weight Average question score for a question of questions Figure Methodology for the assessment system The of the can be varied from sector to sector so that the priorities identified by the assessment is in line with the ground reality Impact of the variation in total score between categories or even sectors can be circumvented by the percentage score The consortium for for the five sectors that was used to assess the 18 case studies is given in annex all Implementation framework Institutional setup In order to ensure that there is sustained implementation of the framework there is a need for a dedicated national level body that is in charge of overseeing efforts towards edge This body will work with key government ministries and agencies to develop the vision and national ESG strategy which on agreement by government ministries will be adopted to pectoral targets and roadmap in discussion with key industrial unions The national level body will also impanel auditors to provide support in the first exercise and carry out subsequent audits Companies will directly report the results of their to this national body Yearly reviews will be conducted with all stakeholders to present the progress made during the years and to implement any course corrections if necessary The national level body will also leverage existing knowledge within the industries through linkages with the undo and other relevant partners The recommended institutional setup is given below 37 Knowledge exchange Yearly industry performance National report .

this national level body is to be decided by relevant actors such as the nice motif etc A steering committee approach can be applied to ensure a quick implementation however such a committee would have limited power and financial support to effectively carry out the aforementioned roles and responsibilities The implementation body could also be designed as a secretariat housed within a key government agency such as the moth or EIC such a body would require significant time and resources for development but will also have greater power and longevity to oversee the development of ESG practices in the country Implementation monitoring As discussed in the previous sections the framework will rely on periodic as well as audits to track company performance and progress The national level body would be responsible for developmental goals of the country its nice and the sags into ESG ambitions by developing sustainability strategies and roadmap at pectoral levels pectoral targets will not only help drive and but also provide a useful metric for measuring performance in line with the cage strategy and other similar programs The extensive exercise outlined for both the pilot project and the compliance program can be conducted using guidelines and questionnaire developed in this project With support from industrial associations pectoral targets would need to be to company level minimum requirements as well as more ambitious targets While the minimum requirements should be uniform across the sector was an effort towards greening the baseline the ambitious targets should be by companies 38 The implementation of the framework should by cyclical in nature with a redefined cycle length anywhere between years at the end of which a detailed assessment of the entire program must be conducted It is critical to ensure that all targets set are in line with the cycle length shorter cycles have less ambitious targets than longer ones The detailed cycle assessment should be presented in front of all stakeholders and the following discussion should provide the foundation for the next cycle strategy 4.3 ESG policy gaps and relevant institutions ESG policy gaps This subchapter identifies ESG policy gaps by analyzing provisions of relevant national policies and regulations against the ESG Framework outlined in Chapter above and contained in Annex For each of the sections on governance Social and Environmental relevant existing legal provisions where matched against Using a traffic light system with gaps partial gaps yellow and no gaps the result of this exercise is shown in Annex Il and briefly summarized in Table 2 below Table Summary of ESG Framework policy gaps by section and Most gaps exist regarding of the sections on Environmental and Governance For the Environmental section gaps regarding the following aspects should be highlighted energy use and energy efficiency equipment and practices use of off grid renewable energy sources as backup for power outages water use and water efficiency waste management practices and thereof noise pollution procurement practices making use of carbon markets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions increasing climate resilience of company operations and taking actions to prevent the loss of biodiversity For the Governance section that currently do not seem to be reflected in national policy or regulation include the sustainability commitment policies and management system of a company as well as issues regarding expertise on sustainability issues the design of supply chains and products in a sustainable manner For the Social section most seem to be partially or fully covered by existing national policies and regulations The findings of the case studies presented in Chapter 5 underline this finding by showing that the highest scores achieved by companies across industry sectors are in the Social section Two notable exceptions regarding the comprehensive existing legislation in this area are with regard to competitive salaries and inclusive hiring practices and production facilities 39 Relevant institutions Addressing the policy and regulatory gaps identified in subchapter above to attract the right type of investment based on ESG criteria requires a concerted effort between different government ministries specialized commissions and agencies industrial development institutes and pectoral business associations Despite ethiopian great progress in this area the identified policy gaps show the need to further increase efforts towards a more ESG compatible industrialization process Especially in the Governance and Environmental areas the existing legislation could be strengthened or new legislation developed The following institutions have been identified as critical players in this context based on their agenda setting capabilities and through their deep pectoral knowledge ministries Ministry of Trade and Industry moth Ethiopian Chamber of Commerce and pectoral Associations Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs Ministry of Finance and Economic Cooperation Ministry of Agriculture moan Ministry of Innovation and Technology mint Ministry of Education moe

companies across the four industrial focus sectors has been twofold 1. To understand where sectors and companies stand in terms of sustainability of their operations and what challenges they face in this regard and 5.2 Methodology Criteria for the selection of case study companies have been developed in close collaboration with the Ethiopian Investment Commission reich and the United Nations Development Programs country office in Ethiopia and included a balance between the four industrial focus sectors with the sugar and industry treated as distinct under the geographic regions within the country companies located within Following the selection criteria a shortlist of suitable potential case study companies was developed from which 18 companies were selected for consultations These 18 case studies were then carried out through a survey and interviews with managers and other company employees from July to October 2020. The following subchapter gives a more overview of the case study companies to serve as context for the case study results Findings on institutional economic social and environmental sustainability of the case study companies are then presented in subchapter based on their assessment against the ESG framework finally subchapter provides insights on how the results of the case studies helped to refine the ESG Framework proposed in chapter 4. 5.3 Case study companies Figure 11 below shows the names locations industrial sectors and ownership structure for the 18 case study companies including four companies from the garment and textile industry five from the leather and leather product industry four from the horticulture industry five from the industry including one from the sugar and industry Travel restrictions imposed due to the pandemic made it necessary to focus on companies located in addis ababa and its vicinity These restrictions also limited the selection of companies located in industrial parks and the number of companies owned fully or partially by local investors 3 While the study had initially only foreseen four case studies the number of case studies was increased to 18 to obtain more salient results across including perspectives of both and companies in each of the four industrial sectors and a separate case study from the sugar and industry 42 tur Textile ply sangria Africa Textile ply ins Manufacturing ply quota Textile Investment ply addis ababa addis ababa Garment Textile Garment Textile Garment Textile act Ta Case study re motion 3 Leather Leather Products companies by name location industry A 7 3 7 or New Wing adds Shoe ply sector and 3 ie ya PIT pres ownership origin of NE so we Leather Leather Products 3 a 3 a Sugar Factory is Ethiopia abe Leather Leather Products 1 ay males rich Food Processing ply Zhang jinxing Tannery oy a duke .

training dedicated experts resources established supplier selection process and utilization of sustainable designs for production or packaging In this regard companies in the and sugar related sector in the horticulture and garment and textile sectors have scored the highest points for sustainability expertise showing a dynamic development process towards sustainability within these sectors On the other hands three companies from the leather sector scored the least points for sustainability expertise reflecting a structural governance issues within the sector Those companies with strong commitment and expertise have established dedicated departments or have hired dedicated personnel overseeing aspects of sustainability and good governance figure 14 below Sustainability commitment Employee Training and Dedicated Experts and Resources To boost the sustainability expertise of companies dedicated experts are dealing with environmental health and safety and quality standards For

Ethiopia see the provision of canteens as an advantage to increase efficiency of operations In addition to canteens 16 companies responded to provide safe and clean drinking water to their employees As transportation to and from work is a constant challenge in Ethiopia and a major hurdle to companies efficiency 13 companies indicated to provide transportation services to their employees to tackle this challenge Only eight companies provide recreation facilities to their employees 55 18 Does your company offer adequate and private 16 well cities for its worker Figure Type of welfare facilities provided by interviewed companies Salary Ethiopia does not have a minimum salary therefore companies usually follow industry wide payment approaches or create their own calculation system to determine the minimum wage at their respective company For example one of the interviewed companies return textile scoring in employee welfare and standards is using a fair remuneration quick scan guide which it accessed through its regular audit process Based on this approach the company takes the average salary compared to employees family size then considers if this could become a minimal living salary for its workers For example according to the company tur Textile pays 1000 et for a cleaning person working at the company All 18 companies say that they pay the same salary for female and male

selected companies Half of the respondents say to hire their workforce on a permanent payroll with the intention to keep them as employees for a longer period figure Almost all companies interviewed provide their employees opportunities for professional growth through regular on the job and external trainings They also offer scheduled annual salary increments and promotions equally eleven companies interviewed have highlighted to pay their employees equal to or more than the local average salary for their respective roles in the company Labor intensive companies within the leather and sectors are frequently using temporary staff when there are peaks in workload Ethiopia provides for annual salary increments based on the annual earning of the company ashram Industrial pays a minimum

payment figure including family health insurance paid leave maternity and paternity leave capacity development severance pay and retirement policy In addition some companies provide allowance For example hans Flowers provides employees working in the cold room where flowers are kept fresh for export a cold allowance of 300 et per months Awash Wine provides full education scholarship for its employees and considers itself to be the pioneer in providing paternity leave even before the law came into force provides a career growth development for its employees allowing them to move up from daily laborer to supervisory position The company also provides on the job training by visiting other flower farms provides maternity leave for 4 months even though the law only stipulates for 3

functioning grievance management system figure For example Awash Wine has established a grievance procedure unit to address any complaint concerning the wellbeing of the workers At hans flowers employees have established a committee to deal with grievance at workplace including a gender committee led by women handling any sensitive harassment issues should they arise East Africa Bottling confirmed to have a secure anonymized mechanisms for grievance expression and redress available to employees Guidelines on how employees can express their grievances are attached to the employees contracts moreover the company has put sealed boxes at its facilities to encourage employees express their grievance secretly and it has also established a harassment prevention committee with periodic anti harassment program At there is a dedicated box collecting comments and the boxes are opened every month to be discussed with management and employees On the other hands two companies from the leather sector have indicated that they do not have an explicit system to express grievances or report harassment issues these issues are mostly dealt with by their human resource department Is there a secure anonymized mechanisms for grievance expression Figure Number of companies having a secure and discrete mechanism for grievance 59 Occupational Health and Safety This includes the following aspects existing rules and procedures for workers available equipment such as suitable personal protective equipment emergency response mechanisms as well as if there are dedicated personnel in the company dealing with health and safety measures Five companies scored full for fulfilling Four companies scored below three in the leather and one in sector showing further improvement is needed Those scoring less than indicated that although they have some sorts of more informal this in place they have not yet established adequate mechanism due to shortage in manpower or lack of knowledge how such systems could be implemented properly Companies who have scored high scores indicated implementing appropriate this measures at workplace constitute an integral part of their activity see Figure Companies oh Measures eyes response per sector Garment Textile Horticulture Leather Leather Products Sugar Sector Are all work Are all workers Do you have Do you provide In case of

adequate and suitable Personal Protective Equipment upper to their employees For example has a dedicated committee for health and safety issues at the company and it provides pie to its employees such as gloves and masks for chemical sprayers Training and Capacity Building Two companies from the leather sector and New Wing shoes both scored for their regular training and capacity building programs On the other hands two companies scored way below as they have not yet established a regular training and capacity building programme for their employees On the hands companies such as vanessa Shoes have used regular trainings to get their prospective employees identified Equal Opportunity In assessing equal opportunity this study looked at fair and transparent hiring practices as well as at inclusive workplace management Four companies from the and horticulture sector scored the highest points They have proper he management in place that allows inclusive and hiring process Especially women and people with disability are given opportunity to work at these companies In this category only two companies from the leather industry are scoring below A sustainable and inclusive work place A part of ethiopians horticulture sector since among the largest exporters of fresh herbs vegetables and flowers The company is well versed in ESG practices given that its European customers require a range of standards and practices in this regard For example is pursuing a resource efficient hydroponics growing system and refuses fertilizer which overall also helps the company save up to Ethiopian bird per months According to they were also the first horticulture company in Ethiopia to recruit hearing impaired workers who considers to be among the most efficient and reliable employees within the company Product Safety Product safety measures how companies are undertaking their quality control to ensure product safety and wellbeing of consumers as well as which methods they have put in place to meet national and international standards In this category three companies scored the highest possible point of two from and one from horticulture sector Although all companies interviewed indicated to have put product quality control system in place figure eight companies scored below showing a room for improvement to set up adequate quality control mechanisms in the textile leather sectors interestingly all companies from the horticulture sector scored above All companies in the horticulture sector do a daily quality check of product standards checking proper cutting stage for flowers as only properly produced flowers will be sold to mostly export clients through auctions or direct sales Companies from the Garment and Textile sector Leather Leather Products sector and sector have indicated to have quality control steps at every step of their production process 61 Do you have a Quality Control division Frequently 6 Every production step Frequency of quality control of product Quality Control division is available products Customer Relations To ensure customer satisfaction companies need to address not just but also after sales support and longterm commitments Product quality as well as follow up support and responses to customers is integral to long term sustainable growth of business Customer satisfaction measures how companies have put in place processes to provide products sales and after sales services and if these services are in line with international standards Companies from garment and textile from leather from horticulture two and from sector three scored the highest possible scoring point of Two companies from the garment and textile sector scored below with one scoring the lowest point possible for customer relation indicating that the company has not yet put in place adequate customer relation services in place Local Community Betterment Companies can have positive impact on local work force and economy ideally all suppliers of a company are local but this is not always feasible since many raw materials may not be available locally Companies can buy as local as possible to grow the local economy support local businesses and reduce cost of transport was well as emissions It is also considered a good practice if companies employ as many local workers as possible if the right skills are available as this promotes the local economy Companies can also undertake activities to support local youth such as internship or work placement programmes to empower them and increase their skills and capabilities contributing directly to the local economic development In addition through Corporate Social Responsibility is companies can initiate community improvement projects and create community awareness All case study companies have active Corporate Social Responsibility programmes and dedicated local improvement projects in their respective communities For example hans Flower score indicated to supply water to most sections of the hole City where the 62 company is located In return the community protects the farm when there is strife around the farm Through its periodic community conversation program at least twice a months Awash Wine has been able to provide concrete betterment activities to the local community where it operates its business This includes provision of bookstores for 200 households for free raising community awareness on waste disposal management as well as lobbying the regional government to get electricity for the community Zhang jinxing Tannery and hoodoo Chen Tannery score contribute to the local community through money donation and supporting of the local security forces tur Textile has built a mosque and supports the community by providing potable water and supporting an orphanage Community Engagement 18 16 16 Corporate Social responsibility Undertaking community programmes to benefit the local improvement projects community Figure Number of companies with car activity Environmental Sustainability The assessment of the 18 case study companies against the draft ESG Framework showed that environmental sustainability is the category against which companies performed the weakest with in average across industrial sectors of only of the maximum scores achieved in comparison to in Governance and in social however the Environmental category also has the largest differences between highest and lowest performing case study companies by indicator including energy water waste pollution procurement resource efficiency climate action and ecosystem impact While for each of the indicators there is one or more case study companies that scored zero there are also many companies that scored on some of the same indicators go water waste procurement resource efficiency and ecosystem impact see Table 10 below The one indicator that stands out as the overall lowest ranking with many companies scoring zero is climate action This indicator is comprised of whether a company measures its carbon footprints utilizes carbon markets to access climate finance and has taken any actions to increase climate resilience of 63 its operations Energy Management practices Energy efficiency Renewable Energy and Energy Management Systems The energy demand of case study companies is predominantly met with electricity from the national grid and through diesel to power generators and boilers Diesel generators are commonly used as backup source for electricity generation in times of power outages of the national grid Companies reported varying frequencies and duration of such power outages ranging from a few short outages per year to frequent and extended outages The overall use of diesel generators to compensate for the power outages varies accordingly and covers between a minor awash wine hans flowers ins manufacturing tur textile quota textile all the way up to least Africa bottling of the individual company energy demand interestingly many of the companies that are using diesel generators stated that they are planning to invest in the installation of solar panels to reduce their dependency on fossil fuels and limit their high energy costs return textile New Wing adds shoes years to increase energy efficiency This includes the replacement of old machines the use of energy recovery processes such as heat recovery from boilers and the use of energy efficient controls such as sensor switches as shown in Figure 27 below 64 Replacement of old machines Use of energy recovery processes water Water Management Practices and Water Efficiency of the case study companies haven put in place measures in the last three years to reduce their use of water of companies have increased the recycling of polluted water for reuse in their operations of companies have increased their reuse of cooling water of companies have increased rainwater harvesting and also have switched their operations to more water efficient technologies or processes of companies reduced their water consumption through fixing of leakage or water losses see Figure 28 below For example ins Manufacturing indicated to use steam efficiency technology for drying towels reducing water usage by of companies taking actions on reduction of water usage Recycling and reuse of water Reuse of cooling water Rainwater harvesting Water efficient technologies processes Fixing of leakage and losses Figure of companies taking actions on the reduction of water usage sei jinxing tannery Innovation in Resource Efficiency and Waste Management The company is located in the city of mojo where a number of other leather tanner s are also producing leather goods for local and international market For more than one years the company was not able to take its solid waste material to the local dumpster due to the closure of the dumpster by the local authorities Confronted with mounting waste material from the tannery the company came up with a new idea to establish a dog food manufacturing facility on its premise and utilize its organic waste as an input for the dog food The company has changed an immediate problem into a product that will become an additional revenue stream once the factory is operational 65 waste Waste Management Practices and Waste and Hazardous Waste While some companies manage to use all of their raw materials other companies for example in the leather and leather products industry have up to of their raw materials going to waste Companies such as Zhang jinxing Tannery are planning to use some part of the organic waste as an input to the dog food factory the company is currently building within its premises In average of the raw materials used by case study companies of the leather and leather products industry ends up as waste In the garment and textile industry this is only around according to responses from case study companies however all case study companies have waste management systems in place and half of the companies regularly raise awareness and provide employee training on waste management practices sangria Africa Textiles The company has invested in sustainable production process to make its integrated denim plant helping it attract a number of additional customers The company uses a state of the art discharge wastewater treatment plant circulating water helping the company reduce its water usage and associated cost substantially furthermore the company converts its discharge to crystals and supplies the crystals to cement manufacturers and leather tanner s as input These dedicated sustainable activities helped the company in reducing waste as well as in lowering its carbon footprints enabling the company receiving a number of certifications from leading international institutions attesting to its sustainable textile production methods sangria is also planning to invest in renewable energy sources to reduce its dependency on electricity from the national grid procurement Raw material packaging Durability and Procurement Practices In average case study companies procure about of their supplies locally This varies significantly between industries with the leather and leather product industry having with the highest average of local procurement and horticulture with only the lowest Low percentage of input for the sector is due to availability of adequate local inputs For example ashram Industrial indicated to import most of its inputs including the raw sunflower seeds In addition Awash Wine highlighted to have very limited local suppliers as it imports majority of its inputs from europe In terms of sustainable procurement of the responding companies ensure that their suppliers are certified in accordance with standards 66 Average local procurement of supplies in of total procurement of supplies by industry Leather leather products including sugar and products Garment textile 0 20 40 60 80 Figure Local procurement of supplies by industry Climate action Carbon footprints Carbon Markets and Climate Resilience Only one of the case study companies is conducting periodic calculations of its carbon footprint ethiopian and only one of the companies is participating in a carbon market scheme awash wine Only about a quarter of the responding companies are concerned about adverse impacts of climate change and have taken actions to increase the climate resilience of their operations Ecosystems impact Biodiversity and Habitat None of the case study companies considers its operation having any adverse impact on local biodiversity More than half of the companies state that they take active steps to prevent the loss of biodiversity go through tree planting The company has established a dedicated department overseeing the recycling of resources across all lines of production Through its recycling practice the company transforms its grape residue into organic fertilizer which is then used on the company farms Beside reducing cost for fertilizer import this practice has also reduced the company footprint on the environment 5.5 Observations Thanks to strong labor policies there is deep understanding of social concerns In most companies general labor standards were observed and adhered to with many companies going out of their way to support their employees This was illustrated by 67 numerous examples one company used parts of their land to grow fruits and vegetables which the employees could take home while others provided advantages like free meals Many industries saw themselves as central to the local socioeconomic fabric and thus extended their support to the local community through efforts such as relief packages Understanding of sustainability is limited especially in domestic companies As described above current of sustainability is heavily skewed towards social elements as opposed to ESG as a whole The experience of conducting the case studies showed that it was difficult to reach a common understanding with the company representatives on the topics covered in the case study questionnaire as there was little institutional knowledge on sustainability especially in domestic companies One direct illustration of this issue is the fact that some of the foreign companies had an appropriate sustainability linked department or personnel who were with the industrial performance and functions under the ESG topics In comparison the domestic companies quite often lacked an equivalent department There are many examples of innovation and investment in sustainability but they are not curated As many of these good practices were evolved organically to serve an existing need such as a leather company establishing a dogwood production factory on the premises to process organic byproducts or a horticulture company working towards constructing wetlands in line with local needs for minimizing impact on environment and therefore often escape notice from a sustainability perspective If these good practices are not adequately captured in an ESG framework this existing inclination towards innovation might get disrupted in favor of compliance measures There is a clear gap between implementing sustainable practices and committing to them There is limited interest in committing to altruistic or supportive good practices from a strategic point of view while companies are willing and interested to support their employees and the local community they are reluctant to include such initiatives at a planning stage as doing so would mean committing to carrying out these actions There is a preference for a more take on sustainable practices wherein no prior commitment and financial pledge is made There is a general sense of reluctance towards public Transparency is a critical feature of ESG framework and indeed one of the key motivations for the same In this context there was a tendency to avoid sharing information that is increasingly observed in the public domain such as financial performance employment statistics etc While company spokesperson were willing to speak about these indicators they were reluctant to show any physical evidence 68 5.6 Refinement of the ESG Framework The initial draft ESG Framework has been refined through various iterations both on its thematic scope and level of detail in the different thematic areas The same accounts for the detailed ESG Assessment Framework as contained in Annex that was used for the assessment of the case study companies The Assessment Framework provides detailed guidelines on delineating sustainable investment compliance requirements that need to be fulfilled at the company level The Assessment Framework allows for compatibility across industrial sectors while at the same time taking into differences between sectors through scorecards The scorecards were developed based on adjusted of scored for sustainability issues that are considered most important for the specific sector see Annex lli The were developed through an operative process based on feedback from Company performance assessment The experience of the case studies also provided insight to important aspects of interventions which have been encapsulated in this version of the report Some key insights were There needs to be greater focus on capacity development particularly for governance and environmental performance The experience of conducting the case studies showed that there is a need for handholding the companies on a number of sustainability indicators This may be due to two reasons a There is a lack of knowledge on sustainability at the level andlor be there is a lack of knowledge at an institutional company level In both cases companies should be encouraged to conduct capacity development programs so that the knowledge can cascade across the organizational hierarchy In a few instances particularly for larger companies with foreign investors the presence of a dedicated sustainability department or personnel helped ensure that at least some information related to ESG was being collected and maintained internally As this framework that intends to raise the sustainability ambitions of industries there is a need to encourage similar efforts towards data duration Not all performance standards are equally matched The ESG framework designed under this project takes a detailed and comprehensive look at sustainability with about 13 indicators covering about 60 across the three categories While this is a valuable endeavor to maintain a robust baseline it is also important to take into consideration the ability of the companies to adequately respond to the questions asked Based on our experience in conducting the 18 case studies we have mapped the different indicators on the ease of obtaining responses o GREEN companies are able and willing to share this information adequately o ORANGE willingness and ability to respond varies o RED companies are either unwilling or unable to adequately share this information The result of this mapping is presented in the table below 69 Table Indicator mapping based on ease of obtaining responses Sustainability Commitment Mission Statement Corporate Policies Management Systems Standards Sustainability Expertise Employee Training Dedicated Experts Resources Sustainability Practices Supply Chain Product Design Transparency Audits Public Disclosure

for companies however note that there are no car planning efforts except in due to supportive associations 70 Energy Management Practices Energy Management Water Management Practices and Processes end Waste Waste Management Hazardous Waste Awareness Raising on Waste Management Practices Climate Resilience Carbon Footprint Carbon Markets end Ecosystem Impacts Biodiversity habitat This mapping highlights the need for greater comprehension and comfort on the side of the company for many indicators especially as highlighted earlier under and end One solution could be to reduce the of such indicators or remove them from the assessment for the time being was low ability to respond indicates a lack of legislative however this does not mean that such indicators should be removed permanently as many of them are considered crucial for ESG assessments rather the aforementioned capacity building program alongside any policy development in this area should take into account this varied understanding of sustainability and identify concrete methods to overcome this issue The assessment questionnaire was cumbersome A general feedback from the ground was that the assessment questionnaire was quite lengthy requiring about half a days worth of time commitment from the companies who were more prepared to engage for an discussion There was also some concern regarding the overlap in the indicators as some questions asked under go have more specific indicators under or While it would be difficult to reduce the questionnaire to of its original size those perceived overlaps in the questionnaire were reviewed and minimized 59 Not counting the contribution to the grid 8 Contingent on local laws and sensitivity to land pollution 51 Especially relevant for textile and garment sector 52 Contingent on location in areas 71 Good practices need to be captured and rewarded outside of the performance standards The case studies brought to light many interesting and innovative efforts towards sustainability Many of these good practices like relief packages or by product set a pioneering example for the sectors while others such as constructing wetlands onsite farming or providing free lunch demonstrate how companies can go out of their way to support their employees and their local environment and community These good practices should be inculcated beyond the boundaries of the performance standards In this regard it would be important to provide a space within the gambit of the framework to curate these examples at a pectoral and national level further innovation alongside compliance will help ensure that companies are motivated to institutionalize sustainability and not just do the bare minimum to meet requirements The framework presented in this report encapsulates the learning from the case studies Additional details on how these lessons can be adequately implemented alongside the framework are given in chapter 6. 72 6 Recommendations on the framework The ESG Framework for Ethiopia presented in this document is a result of research and analyses of various similar framework across the world and is tailored by ESG and sustainability experts for the Ethiopian context with a particular focus on the garment textile horticulture leather and leather products and including sugar related sectors in the country The framework tested on a small section of the industry representatives has been received positively and has been over the past several months to make it relevant and specific to the target sectors The experience from the ground shows a motivated if inconsistent policy and practice landscape with encouraging examples of innovation and good practices The aim of implementing the framework then begins to hone these existent skills while providing a stronger foundation to industrial sustainability Building on the observations presented in the previous chapter the following overarching recommendations can be provided 73 stakeholders FINANCING Figure Key aspects of framework To provide a more perspective these recommendations have been deepened into concrete next steps that can be applied to successfully the 6.1 Next steps Institutional setup to the ESG A National Steering Committee comprising of representatives from key Ministries and agencies industries academia national and international sustainability experts should 74 be formed to oversee the planning of the framework in the coming years The main function of this committee would be Leading the work on policy formulation and amendments in line with the framework requirements Initiating necessary efforts towards the framework through a dedicated national body detailed below Overseeing formulation of capacity development curricular to be implemented alongside the framework Acting as an intermediary between the Governmental entities and industrial sector in finalizing the framework elements Recommended time of Year 1 We recommend the formation of a dedicated and empowered body national Sustainable Investments Body nibs at the national level that can oversee the implementation of the framework and act as an interface between the industries and the Government agencies The nib will be a distinct body from the nsa as the latter would have supervisory powers over the former Such a body can be housed within nice and partially if not fully funded by a sustainable investments or that can be levied on investors both foreign and domestic with the aim of ensuring high quality standards Support from financing institutions could also be procured for funding this body or existing facilities such as the cage Facility under could be used to provide the initial funding to set up the nibs Key responsibilities of the nib would be Executing the strategy document and its key tenets by preparing periodic implementation plans developing and signing contracts with relevant stakeholders particularly industries industry associations and auditors Designing and planning capacity building endeavors such as industries along with training of trainers sessions for auditors and personnel from associated Ministries or agencies Developing and implementing a certification process for certifying trained auditors and aii Companies successfully achieving their ESG targets on periodic reviews Implementing a stringent monitoring protocol by housing a neutral body of auditors that govern the impaneled This would be a clean transparent body that holds all auditors responsible for the audits and ensures fair transparent and balanced audit reports Negotiating the terms of reference for incentives related to ESG performance between Ministries and industries Maintaining a record of performance on participating sectors and companies and releasing periodic reports which highlight the experiences strengths challenges and good practices observed This report should be shared with agencies such as the sip 75 Develop guidelines for specific elements of framework implementation as and when required such as the template and methodology for audits to be followed by all participants Planning subsequent phases of framework implementation compliance phase compliance driven development phase and competitive index participation phase based on previous experiences including relevant as continuous improvement is the key to a strong ESG Recommended time of Year 2 for Planning the framework implementation thorough stakeholders mapping and analysis exercise should be conducted to understand not only their interests in sustainable investments but to also capture their perspectives on sustainability and existing capacity Some key stakeholders consider are Ministries and Agencies mandated to oversee investments in Ethiopia such as EIC and moth as they will be tasked with the ownership of the framework Ministries and Agencies mandated to protect environmental and social rights such as the mecca and most as they can guide the framework implementation plan Ethiopian Standards agency Ministry of finance National Bank of Ethiopia andlor similar bodies including commissions agencies and specialized entities that can provide support to the framework under SIP and other agencies with presence in Ethiopia and interest in national sustainability endeavors Industries and industry associations from the target sectors Domestic and foreign investors operating in ethiopian to understand their approach to sustainability and experience in other contents and civil society organizations entrenched in the area of sustainable development who can share unbiased perspectives on the framework implementation plan The stakeholders mapping should first take into account the interests and influences of the stakeholders ideally through a simple matrix approach see Figure secondly through engagement their understanding of sustainability particularly in the context of sustainable investments should be discerned This will help identify and awareness raising needs within the stakeholders cohorts Recommended list of stakeholders is provided in Chapter Section 76 Tobe actively Key Players consulted and kept Drivers satisfied To be engaged regularly qot a win oT INTEREST Should be shown consideration kept informed INTEREST Figure A simple matrix approach to stakeholders mapping On the basis of the stakeholders mapping a series of consultations need to be planned with high priority stakeholders to develop the vision and plan for framework deployment This is necessary to strengthen the framework with adequate inputs from the stakeholders Important elements of the framework that should be discussed include oO 0 O Oo Implementation plan for the compliance phase targets duration process etc along with a roadmap for subsequent phases compliance driven development and competitive index participation Monitoring and reporting protocols to be followed Roles and responsibilities of key stakeholders Incentives for participation for industries and industry associations Financing mechanisms for implementing the framework These consultations should be initiated and chaired by the nice Involvement of industries and industry associations is extremely important at this stage as the first stage of framework implementation is voluntary in nature The ESG assessment system questionnaire prepared for this project provides detailed guidelines on areas that companies need to focus on and how auditors can assess the performance To ease usage across auditors and to ensure that there is no change or discrepancies this assessment system should be atomized and evolved into an intuitive and tool that can generate questionnaires and save responses into a central database that can be housed with the A web tool with dedicated dashboard for different users companies industry associations 77 auditors nibs ministries can also be considered as such a tool will ease the process of and report generation Recommended time of Year 2 Legislative and Policy support to boost ESG Based on the stakeholders consultations a strategy document should be written and formalized to govern developments in sustainable investments The aim of this document should be to align ESG ambitions to existing national level strategies and legislation such as the crew her etc and outline the key actors institutional mandates roles and responsibilities financing mechanisms and a roadmap to be achieved This document will act as the foundation for the framework implementation and thus should be prepared with extensive involvement of all key stakeholders The writing of this document should be spearheaded by the nice with the nib being the custodians of its contents The legislative mapping presented in this report shows existing laguna in policies with regards to sustainable industrial practices To take this work forward amendments to existing legislation such as the Environmental act Industrial Development policy Foreign Investment policy etc or supportive legislation must be developed and implemented before or alongside the framework implementation in order to ensure that there is a foundation to the requirements put forth by the framework especially from companies This will be particularly important for some of the performance standards under Governance and Environmental categories such as car investment disclosure climate resilience water consumption and audits etc Implementing the ESG framework National Once the strategy document is by nibs companies from selected sectors should be invited to participate in the pilot phase voluntary compliance of the framework implementation Care needs to be taken to ensure that there is diversity among the selected companies in terms of size ownership location etc short term incentives should be made available for the participating companies On selection companies will need to work with the industry association and the nib to define their sustainability ambition While certain targets will be set companies should also be encouraged to be innovative in their approach to sustainable practices Recommended time of Year 3 An extensive set of capacity building curricular need to be developed in consultation with one or more national training institute with the aim to introduce a holistic perspective to sustainability There is a wide group of stakeholders that will be directly or indirectly 78 affiliated with for indeed impacted by this ESG framework To ensure that all stakeholders are on topics covered under the framework and sustainability in general different capacity development programs will be required such as o halfway conclave on sustainable industries to introduce the concept of sustainability and its relevance to ethiopian development initiatives in general and the industrial sector in specific for Ministries and Agencies laterally associated with the framework o oneday workshop on sustainable investments for all key stakeholders identified in the mapping exercise This event will walk the participants through the framework and its implementation plan to align all expectations o today introduction to the framework programs for companies and associations in a sector that will introduce the framework and its elements and outline the steps that need to be taken at company and pectoral level to meet the framework requirements This program will be targeted at the management level and should include field visits to exemplary companies o Two day training of trainers sessions aimed at the body of impartial auditors for training third party auditors seeking o Two for certification program for auditors that will detail out the step by step process they need to conduct during the sustainability assessments of companies o Longer programs for company officers to understand the concept and elements of sustainability and how to them Unlike the other programs that can be organized under nibs this course should be offered by training institutes and aim at building capacity of officers and engineers in sustainability make them sustainability officers Recommended time of Year 2 onwards Individuals or firms with experience in conducting sustainability audits can be impaneled with the nib and be charged with conducting the periodic audits required under the framework impaneled auditors should be required to complete the certification program highlighted above with a refresher course being conducted periodically An extensive exercise has been identified as the first step of the pilot phase The assessment system prepared for this project and used for the case studies can be used as a basis for the questionnaire however it should be kept in mind that the intent of a baseline is not to assign value to current practices but to capture the existing reality thus this exercise should try to capture deep data from participating companies across all three and categories Apart from speaking to senior management auditors conducting the baseline should prioritize field visits and one anyone interviews with employees 79 The pilot phase of the framework beginning with the exercise should be implemented for a set cycle period between say years Companies will be required to pursue the targets set for them whether they are common across the sector or oriented to the company with and yearly audits being conducted through the cycle period Recommended time of Year 4 onwards Existing pectoral bodies such as industry associations are critical entities in ensuring successful implementation of sustainable investment practices In this context industry associations should be involved in all planning discussions regarding the framework implementation plan They can also play an active role in ensuring effective uptake of the framework by taking certain measures Given that the pilot phase will require mobilization of institutional policy and financial levers industry associations can support these endeavors by introducing pectoral standards pectoral standards in line with the ESG framework These standards can be evolved into performance standards under the framework over time thus becoming a key feature of the sector and not an additional expectations The existing standards in the sector are a good example of this Governance and Environmental standards in particular will be an important area of implementation for these standards Recommended time of Year 1 for Industry associations can also help drive innovations by supporting the nib in promoting good practices in sustainability through periodic award systems wherein best performing companies are publicly recognized Recommended time of Year 4 Industry associations can also partner with nib in capacity development by ensuring that their members and management committee are appropriately trained Recommended time of Year Other industries can build on the successful example of the Ethiopian Horticulture Producer Exporters association Code of practice which in itself is an ESG framework It provides the sector a voluntary system of continuous professional and technical development monitoring and into the sector and is designed to address market and civil society concerns about standards for social and environmental performance in the sector and also to guide the sustainable development of the sector Participating companies sit at the core of the framework and are instrumental to any efforts in implementing sustainable industrial practices In this context they are highly important to all aspects of the framework At an individual level companies can begin with familiarizing themselves with the concept of sustainable industries particularly with the ESG performance standards Whilst executing the requirements of the framework companies can also implement the following Planning for sustainability by making budgetary and strategic decisions in favor of sustainable practices This will include budgeting for a sustainability officer if not a department reviewing existing processes protocols policies and systems to ensure they are and efficient setting internal targets and targets etc Conducting periodic and capacity building on sustainability through nib approved curriculum for both staff and management Recommended time of Year 3 onwards Preparing and submitting accurate unbiased and reports on sustainability performance focusing on both successes and areas of improvement A set of specific guidelines on good practices for companies was also developed under the gambit of this project and is available in Annex ivy 81
