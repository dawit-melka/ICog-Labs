growth in supply Ethiopia has the competitive advantage to produce yarn at low cost and service this market but currently lacks the capacity to do so globally the demand for Ethiopian cotton yarn has been increasing by per year as a result of increased quality of yarn production in Ethiopia The investment opportunity is in a cotton spinning mill in Ethiopia The cotton spinning plant will source its raw materials locally and serve both local and export markets new world class equipment will be used to ensure top quality yarn produced The opportunity requires a capital investment of us and is expected to generate an internal rate of return of over 5 years The project is expected to create 260 job opportunities in Ethiopia Enabling naming Key strategies policies and incentives implemented
