International Trade Centre through its Partnership for Investment and Growth in Africa project to identify all current laws regulations and local and international best practices related to sustainability There is a special focus on Chinese investment in this handbook This has to do with the fact that Chinese investors represent close to of the FDI inflow to ethiopian and a large number

Partnership for Investment and Growth in Africa Sustainable Development Goal United Nations Executive summary Over the past two decades China has become Africa s biggest economic partner More than firms operate in african around of which are privately owned In manufacturing it is estimated that of Africa s industrial production valued at some billion a years is handled by Chinese firms Many Chinese enterprises have committed to longterm engagement in african particularly in the manufacturing and agricultural sectors This provides significant opportunities to support local communities and local economies in their development efforts through sustainable investment practices While many companies engage in sustainable business practices there are lessons to be learned and room for improvement Despite the strong push by the Chinese government to encourage responsible business conduct overseas the increasing amount of mandatory standards and voluntary framework are unlikely to achieve their desired impact without proper dissemination implementation uptake and incentives This publication provides guidance to Chinese investors on how to comply with environmental and social sustainability requirements and additional sustainability practices in ethiopian It breaks down the mandatory requirements and voluntary guidance and standards relevant to the and light manufacturing sectors in the country The Partnership for Investment and Growth in Africa framework aims to increase exports and local development by promoting foreign investments and business partnerships in two productive sectors and light manufacturing in ethiopian kenya and zambian Developed under the pig framework this handbook also aims to support the implementation of the United Nations Sustainable Development goals How to use this handbook Chapter 2 GET LOCAL Get relevant advice to incorporate in your investment practices Learn about the existing legal framework in ethiopian as well as which environmental and labour laws you need to comply with and where to seek support Chapter 3 TOOLS FOR SUSTAINABLE BUSINESS IMPACT Benefit from guidance on some additional sustainability practices to maximize sustainable investment and operations Why invest sustainably The three pillars of sustainability social environmental and economic are interconnected and interdependent meaning that a company is unlikely to achieve longterm economic success without taking into account the social and environmental factors related to business operations Businesses have a key role to play in contributing to the delivery of the 17 sags which set global priorities and aspirations for 2030 in terms of social environmental and economic development The Chinese Government is increasingly putting pressure on companies to comply with environmental and social legislation and to improve reporting on corporate social responsibility practices Sustainable business operations not only support the environment and workers but also help create strong longterm business foundations Implementing measures that improve working conditions and relationships with the community and government help companies improve efficiency develop a better workforce and improve their economic performance It is important that investors understand and comply with environmental and labour requirements in the country of operations but there is also a wide range of voluntary standards that businesses can adopt to increase sustainability and international competitiveness Legal requirements in Ethiopia Investors are required to obtain an environmental licence for their proposed development which is granted following the successful production and review of an environmental impact assessment heian or Project Report for low risk projects Environmental requirements for the business are determined by the via or Project Report process Compliance with via requirements and all relevant environmental regulations will be monitored and businesses are required to submit an environmental audit each years noncompliance with environmental requirements can result in improvement requirements which if not followed can result in closure imprisonment and financial penalties Labour laws are determined by a range of legislation and it is important that the company understands and complies with relevant legislation Land regulations are also important to consider particularly in terms of leasing or purchasing land where it is vital to ensure that alternative community or tribal rights are considered and respected Understanding additional sustainability practices There are many opportunities to incorporate additional sustainable measures and approaches into investment and business operations Additional sustainability measures can encompass an array of practices targeting different sustainability areas such as community relations labour rights and resource management Voluntary sustainability standards are available for social accountability and environmental management and for a wide range of sector and processes There are networks throughout Africa that can also be a good source of information and inspiration CHAPTER 1 CHAPTER 1 Why invest sustainably KEY MESSAGES Sustainable investment practices require operations that have a minimal negative impact and maximum positive impact on the global and local environment community and economy At a minimum this requires ensuring that mandatory environmental and social regulations are fully addressed and that additional voluntary measures are considered as well The three pillars of sustainability social environmental and economic are interconnected and interdependent meaning that a company is unlikely to achieve longterm economic success without taking into account the social and environmental factors related to business operations Businesses have a key role to play in contributing to the delivery of the United Nations 17 Sustainable Development Goals which set global priorities and aspirations for 2030 in terms of social environmental and economic development Basic concepts avoid corruptive practices internally within their supply chains and with government stakeholders Embedding sustainable investment practices By adopting sustainable investment practices into a business means ensuring that mandatory businesses embrace economic environmental and environmental and social regulations are social factors in a balanced way to provide a long fully addressed while additional sustainability term business foundation that is in harmony with considerations are implemented from the start the society local communities and the environment of a business and carried out through its regular These practices create value that goes beyond operations moreover it means that business economic profits but also includes social benefits and operations should be based on principles to reduced environmental impact in the invested country com The integration of economic environmental The three sustainability pillars and social factors into business and investment decisions is the foundation of the concept of Figure 1 represents the three pillars of sustainability sustainability In the business context sustainability for investment practices and their These refers to the ability of businesses to meet the needs pillars are interconnected and interdependent of the present without compromising the ability meaning that longterm economic success of a of future generations to meet their own needs 2 company cannot exist without taking into account Sustainability can also relate to the capacity of the social and environmental factors related to businesses to create longterm value by addressing business operations Box 1 also describes anti environmental and social considerations in their corruption as a complementary and important part business strategy of sustainable

creation and profitability BOX i as a complementary sustainability pillar Corruption encompasses different illegal and illicit acts such as bribery extortion embezzlement and money laundering No business can be considered sustainable andlor responsible without embedding policies in its operations Beyond the three sustainability pillars companies should also take into account their business conduct with employees supply chains surrounding communities and government officials Adopting practices in this regard is fundamental to ensure sustainable investment practices it stock com The UN Sustainable Development Goals More companies worldwide have been integrating sustainable practices into their investment decisions and business operations By doing so companies contribute to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 2015. This agenda sets a global development framework composed of AND wellbeing DECENT WORK AND ECONOMIC GROWTH 13 tox SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT un 17 Sustainable Development Goals covering the three sustainability pillars discussed above The 2030 Agenda highlights that private business activity investment and innovation are major drivers of productivity inclusive economic growth and job creation calls on all businesses to apply their creativity and innovation to solve sustainable development challenges CLEAN WATER AND SANITATION 17 16 peace JUSTICE AND STRONG INSTITUTIONS 1 ya DEVELOPMENT GOALS Sustainable investment initiatives of Chinese companies overseas The Chinese Government endorses the global call for business action in contributing to the 2030 agenda particularly via sig 17 partnerships with private actors my The Chinese Government is increasingly putting pressure on companies to comply with environmental and social legislation and to improve reporting on Corporate Social Responsibility practices The national and international context requires companies to take sustainable practices seriously if they want to be competitive and retain business Major risks of noncompliance with sustainability requirements include loss of reputation andlor license to operate in certain markets companies are increasingly investing overseas and Africa is a focus area for investment in and light manufacturing The rapid expansion of Chinese investments in Africa has attracted global attention More than firms operate in african around of which are privately owned In manufacturing it is estimated that of african industrial production valued at some billion a years is handled by Chinese firms There is much debate and discussion on the impact of Chinese investments on the economies and governance of African countries as well as their environmental and social conditions Failure to commit to sustainable practices might generate a negative perception and threaten the success of Chinese companies in emerging markets China s vision The Chinese Government explicitly aims for outbound Chinese investment to contribute to the realisation of the sags and the 2030 agenda For instance in the Chinese Government launched Guidelines for Environmental Protection in Foreign Investment and cooperation which provide recommendations for companies operating abroad This drive for more investment and operations is also reflected in the Belt and Road Initiative As part of this initiative China s Vision and Actions on Jointly Building Silk Road Economic Belt and Century Maritime Silk Road paper from 2015 encourages Chinese enterprises to participate in sustainable industrial investment in BRI countries It states that BRI will support localized operation and management of Chinese companies to boost the local economy increase local employment improve local livelihoods and take social responsibilities in protecting local biodiversity and More Chinese companies adopt sustainability practices In the domestic Chinese market sustainability factors are becoming the norm and are starting to help define a more successful approach for business operations For example Chinese companies that have chosen to disclose their environmental social and governance data have been producing higher returns than their peers Chinese companies ranked in the top percentile according to their score gained higher returns than their peers in according to bloomers data the Hang send China stock exchange i Starting from Chinese listed companies will need to disclose the ESG risks associated with their operations following requirements set by the China Securities Regulatory commission in collaboration with China s Ministry of Environmental protection to A environment for Chinese companies going global Creating a business environment in alignment with the global development goals contributes to longterm sustainable business operations of Chinese companies operating in any given country In exchange for great opportunities going global inevitably means facing various challenges This includes a challenging business environment the need to understand and comply with national regulations and accessing or training an appropriately skilled workforce Many of the African countries in which Chinese companies invest have significant development challenges with economies constrained by limitations including poor infrastructure and weak education and health sectors There are also many environmental challenges Fragile ecosystems are facing huge pressures from the challenges of a changing climate as well as commercial agriculture rapid urbanization industrial development and population growth This context underpins the need to invest sustainably and responsibly in ethiopian The country has consistently demonstrated how business partnerships between China and Africa can be mutually beneficial sustainable investment in the country is vital for success of chinese owned companies If investment is focused on economic gain without ensuring that local communities and economies can benefit or with disregard to local environmental and health issues companies are likely to suffer from a serious backlash This can result in increased operating costs and security risks legal disputes and other challenges It can also lead to a damaged reputation among customers and potential loss of business as a results The business case for sustainable investments Sustainable measures not only support the environment and workers but also help create strong long term business foundations Implementing measures that improve working conditions and relationships with the community and government help companies improve efficiency develop a better workforce and improve their economic performance Failing to ensure robust environmental and social measures including can result in significant backlash and loss of business Fair remuneration helps to retain staff and reduce costs relating to high turnover and repeated training Working with local supply chains can reduce costs and improve quality as well as enhance the local economy The financial benefits of sustainable investment usually outweigh the costs furthermore incorporating sustainability helps business owners anticipate and reduce risks before they incur monetary or reputation losses For example investing in workers wellbeing local communities and supply chains enables companies to benefit from a loyal and workforce which is likely to lead to better quality products and higher economic returns moreover companies can strengthen their business reputation and economic foundations by reducing negative environmental impacts implementing more efficient production practices and managing waste to ensure local communities can prosper The business case for sustainable investment is compelling for the longterm success of businesses in African countries With young populations and high growth rates they are set to grow into some of the world s most dynamic markets in the coming decades The key arguments for sustainable investments are set out below in terms of the business benefits that come from Operating in an manner Operating in a manner i Strengthening local supply chains and increased transparency and reduced corruption we ethiopian Sustainable investment in and light manufacturing Caring for the environment is good for business Responsible environmental practices can serve to improve the economic strengthen business reputation decrease businesses environmental footprint and ensure a healthier local ecosystem that benefits and attracts employees In fact environmental responsibility has become a requirement for many companies that export their goods to international markets Buyers are increasingly introducing codes of conduct related to environmental and social responsibility for their suppliers and requesting them to comply with third party certification processes Responsible environmental management can strengthen a business reputation with its customers in china europe North american and elsewhere Implementing practices for waste management as well as water and energy use can also lead to cost savings by reducing the quantity of inputs needed for production while improving productivity at the company level Agriculture in particular relies on sustainable practices in order to survive longterm investments should strive to ensure environmental conditions that allow strong crop fields can continue into the future Reducing the possible impact of pesticides on valuable insect populations and water resources should be a consideration of all investors in the sector In general those companies that invest sustainably have higher investor interest as described in Box 2. BOX i Sustainability performance and access to finance today the environmental and social impact of a project is an important assessment indicator in the due diligence conducted by development banks and commercial banks prior to making investments The shift to cleaner production and a approach in the manufacturing and agricultural sectors is also increasingly rewarded by stronger investor interest Companies that are socially responsible often tend to be more transparent and able to provide investors with greater levels of information and therefore more confidence Failing to ensure robust environmental measures can result in significant backlash and loss of business For example in the Government of Chad suspended the operations of a Chinese oil company based in the country after it was found that their operations had resulted in numerous polluted waterways and oil spills Damaging the local environment can also lead to discontent from the local government and local community that supplies labour to the company Improving businesses reputation through a responsible approach to workers and communities While conducting research among chinese owned companies in each of the pig countries it became clear that fair remuneration and labour conditions can help retain staff and reduce costs relating to high turnover and repeated training There is a strong financial case for firms to invest in their workforce with fair wages and provide skills training that boosts career progression and employee satisfaction While cheap labour is one of the attractive aspects of investing in many African countries a sustainable system must allow workers to benefit from wages that enable them to purchase food pay for lodging and buy basic necessities Estimating a living wage is often dependent on the specific country and sector however it is important for companies to help establish operations whereby their employees are able to meet their own and their dependents basic needs This can go beyond increasing employees wages and include other services such as providing meals transportation housing and education In addition to increasing the satisfaction and productivity of workers these services can have the added value of improving community relations In some factories across african this is still not the case Poverty does not lead to good productivity There is increasing evidence that workers who are paid above average wages will be more loyal and productive Beyond national regulations and labour laws there are also many additional sustainability measures that businesses can put in place to increase the wellbeing of their workers and the sustainable development of the communities in which they are located Some of the most important are described in Chapter 3 of this handbook core Beyond the immediate workforce it is also important to help bring the local community along on the journey of investing in their region Extensive consultation with local leaders and proactive and positive communication with community leaders and media outlets can help to identify and mitigate potential problems before they escalated moreover investing in the local community can help develop a local economy that attracts more businesses and consumers thereby expanding the market of the investors company and the wellbeing and productivity of local employees It is also important to be sensitive to land tenure in African countries Land is seen as a family s most valuable assets If these issues are not taken seriously conflicts are likely to arise between investors and local communities where they operate increasing risks to profitability and the longterm success of the business When resettlement of local residents is required perhaps as a result of purchasing a large area of land for agriculture or industrial used it is important to follow appropriate national and international standards The International Finance Corporation Resettlement Performance Standards provide a comprehensive framework for these processes Local supply chains reduce costs and improve quality Companies investing in Ethiopia can also play a role in developing local supply chain businesses supply chains which are geographically concentrated can have many benefits in terms of reducing transport costs for materials in the supply chain being able to easily discuss and improve energies between manufacturing processes and developing more of a recognized cluster and brand around a certain product Reducing transportation distances has the added benefit of reducing the carbon footprint of products which can be advertised as an additional selling point to customers many of whom are buying sustainable products at an increasing rate At the same time encouraging local suppliers to be part of the value chain can provide market opportunities for micro small and enterprises in the local market where business and employment is often greatly needed and appreciated Supporting local innovation and entrepreneurship can also lead to higher quality local supply chains particularly over a longer timeframe Setting up local subsidiaries or forming collaborative arrangements with local firms can create significant benefits for investors in accessing local knowledge and understanding the political context while transferring skills and technology to local partners The value of transparency and policies Corruption is one of the greatest barriers to social and economic development in African countries as reported by Transparency international Bribery practices cause negligence in environmental and social impact assessment processes as well as many other situations where compliance with regulations is bypassed Bribery is sometimes reported by investors as a necessary part of getting anything done however participating in corrupt practices even when pressured to do so by local government representatives is increasingly risky Many firms investing in Africa have come to realize the damage caused by bribery Chinese law has evolved to address key issues for addressing breaches of legal requirements by companies overseas Strong corporate governance and practice is important to minimize such risk It also helps in the due diligence process when seeking further investment and helps to reduce reputation risk Legal requirements voluntary standards and corporate social responsibility mA clear distinction can be made between legal requirements voluntary measures and standards and additional corporate social responsibility initiatives all of which contribute to sustainable business otis important that investors understand and comply with relevant legislation as summarized in Chapter 2. There is a wide range of voluntary standards that businesses can comply with to increase international competitiveness While business survival is the priority when starting out in a challenging business environment it is important to stress that doing anything beyond the national legislation to improve sustainability and responsibility is better than nothing There are several straightforward measures that can improve working conditions and sustainable outcomes An important part of implementing sustainable business practices is to understand the difference between legal requirements voluntary measures and standards and additional car initiatives Legal requirements Legislation and mandatory standards National legislation sometimes referred to as hard law relating to environmental and social requirements varies across African countries including in ethiopian Recognising them and complying with them is the bare minimum that businesses must do more on this in Chapter Mandatory standards are required by governments and are mandatory for any product or service to be legally commercialized in that market These standards can cover product or packaging characteristics or certain processes that need to be followed Examples of these standards are technical regulations sanitary and measures including health and safety regulations product specifications labelling requirements quality controls and rules of origin They differ depending on the product and the country of export noncompliance with these requirements may lead to quarantining or product rejection by import countries ethiopian Sustainable investment in and light manufacturing penn Integrating voluntary sustainability standards Over the last decades a new generation of voluntary sustainability standards sometimes referred to as soft law has emerged to cover all sectors and industries These include voluntary guidelines initiatives codes and standards developed by international organisations companies business associations organizations governments and initiatives They provide additional guidelines for sustainable business practices Demonstrating adherence to these standards is often necessary for businesses to operate profitably in global markets The wide range of voluntary standards include the following schemes international governance agreements and guidelines such as The International Labour Organization pilot Multinational Enterprises omnes Declaration The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development Guidelines for Multinational enterprises The Global compact established by the un Guiding Principles on Business and Human rights established by the UN Human Rights Office of the High Commissioner international initiatives providing standards for the social and environmental practices of firms at home and abroad This includes standards developed by the International Organization for such as the ISO 26000 standard Guidance on Social Responsibility launched in 2010. Private voluntary sustainability standards providing principles andlor requirements that producers traders manufacturers retailers or service providers may be asked to meet covering different sustainability metrics Hundreds of industry association codes are in existence covering major areas of national and international commercial activity including manufacturing and agriculture Thousands of company codes with specific policies on social and environmental issues particularly among multinational corporations The proliferation of voluntary sustainability standard schemes can cause challenges particularly for companies operating in value chains that may be compelled to comply with numerous voluntary standard schemes that have potentially high costs to demonstrate compliance This has led to standard schemes often being perceived by Chinese companies as a barrier to market entry or a complication that can be avoided Many Chinese companies do not engage with these voluntary standard schemes because of familiarity with the rules of the game weak networks with relevant organisations and a lack of guidance however this approach could impede Chinese enterprises international competitiveness in a market that increasingly demands environmental sustainability and social responsibility It is more likely that Chinese companies will become a force in shaping the next generation of sustainability standards in global markets as a competitive edge aligned with China s broader global policies on sustainable development Many investors are convinced that promoting prudent and sustainable business practices in line with both national regulations and voluntary standards makes economic sense in the long terms An additional point is that many national governments are increasingly using the dynamic space of voluntary standards as a testing ground for how they could inform mandatory requirements It is therefore better to be aware of and be able to comply with a wide range of voluntary social and environmental standards in order to be prepared to meet legal requirements as they are introduced A further distinction can be made for additional car activities For the purpose of this handbook car is defined as activities or initiatives that are outside of the core business activities and include initiatives such as improving sustainable access to drinking water for local communities and contributing to education or healthcare facilities and resources Additional car initiatives can help local communities to develop and support cultural events that are vital to engagement integration and mutual understanding between investors and local communities Research suggests that a high proportion of Chinese enterprises investing overseas are already aware of the positive impacts of car initiatives Interviews carried out with Chinese companies to inform this handbook found that many of them consider car an important part of Chinese culture to give something to the communities in which they work A company can achieve significant positive reputation benefits from implementing car initiatives however it is important that businesses do not use car as a cover to hide unsustainable business operations It is also important that car initiatives are based on or compliant with national development strategies in the host country Throughout the different processes to set up their business companies are expected to comply with legal sustainability requirements established by the country and adopt additional sustainability measures to mitigate potential sustainability impacts of their business operations Figure 2 summarizes the main legal sustainability requirements and additional sustainability considerations that companies should adhere to during the three key stages of business operations Legal requirements and additional sustainability considerations throughout business operations LEGAL REQUIREMENTS ADDITIONAL SUSTAINABILITY CONSIDERATIONS

sustainability measures ADDITIONAL SUSTAINABILITY MEASURES Beyond the legal requirements set out in Chapter i there are many opportunities to incorporate additional sustainable measures and approaches into investment and business operations Additional sustainability measures can encompass an array of practices targeting different sustainability areas such as community relations labour rights and resource management Voluntary sustainability standards are available for social accountability and environmental management and for a wide range of sector and processes There are business networks and groups throughout Africa that can also be a good source of information and inspiration on sustainable investment practices Apart from compliance with national regulations there are many opportunities for companies to incorporate more sustainable approaches into their operations particularly in light manufacturing and businesses This chapter introduces a number of measures that companies can incorporate into their business operations in ethiopian to help implement a sustainable approach summarized in Figure Relevant Chinese and international voluntary standards are also highlighted at the

consider the location of their proposed manufacturing or site in the context of sustainable development factors These include the following Connecting to upstream andlor downstream local value chains There may be opportunities to maximize the benefits to local businesses farmers or producers of different supplies and materials such as food building and raw materials This can often have significant business advantages such as lower costs for materials or transport and improved relations between investors and surrounding communities Taking a proactive approach to addressing challenges Land rights can involve complex procedures in many countries Even if companies follow the national laws on land compensation there is still likely to be backlash from local communities if they feel unfairly compensated or treated It is advisable for companies to do their own due diligence and speak to local community leaders in addition to local and national governments It is most appropriate to consider this in detail at the via stage Investors have a unique opportunity to develop sustainable approaches in the production or manufacturing of products Beyond the legislation discussed in Chapter i it is possible to implement processes that minimize electricity or water used minimize greenhouse gas emissions such as cop or develop circular economy systems that minimize wastage This could include the following Implementing systems to capture and reuse rain water Having good maintenance systems to prevent leakage and water waste Maximizing the energy efficiency of machinery lighting and buildings Considering how groundwater supplies may be limited and are shared with the surrounding community as well as practicing the sustainable use of water sourced from borehole Adopting practices that avoid waste and reusing inputs or whenever not possible recycling waste appropriately Reducing emissions and pollution from manufacturing processes and vehicles and by minimizing other activities such as burning waste materials Minimizing the carbon footprint of a business through the measures above as well as by adopting renewable energy sources and sourcing food and materials from local suppliers Minimizing the use of pesticides and fertilizers as some may have negative impacts on surrounding water quality and the health of human and animal populations i Using if possible which are designed to reduce the harmful impacts of fertilizers on the environment while providing similar benefits to crops . my ER Working conditions Providing workers with better conditions and opportunities can lead to benefits such as higher levels of productivity low levels of staff turnover and financial savings Investors can consider developing a living wage for employees through an array of measures that may include adequate wages housing food transportation education and childcare communication and health benefits Providing local transport for workers to and from their place of employment can provide a safe and efficient additional benefit to workers Workers may often need to walk between home and work so reducing the distance will also improve punctuality and energy levels at work It will also improve safety particularly if workers need to travel after dark Providing meals and areas to eat for workers can help boost productivity As discussed in Chapter i many workers on low wages struggle to buy enough nutritious food Providing workers with good quality food at the workplace can help to improve morale and productivity as well as fostering loyalty Companies should consider investing in accommodation and communication capacities for workers Where a business wishes to invest for a long duration a case can be made for providing housing for workers which can significantly reduce staff turnover and increase productivity In order to pass supply chain audits accommodation must comply with international standards such as the ill standards for worker accommodation It is important to ensure that housing plans fit into local spatial development plans where relevant It can also be beneficial to provide means of communication for workers especially in cases where many have travelled far from home to work in a factory or industrial zone Providing employees with phone cards or having a company phone that can be used by employees on a regular basis can help them stay in contact with their families Employers can also play a role in improving the safety and security of their workers particularly women First and foremost employers need to be adamant in ensuring that there are no abuses within the company structure paying special attention to power differences between managers and subordinates There must be means of reporting abuses outside of the management chain with the promise of anonymity so that the subordinate does not fear retaliation for reporting Companies can also help ensure security by providing dedicated transport and accommodation security surveillance and basic personal alarms for employees Respecting differences language barriers and cultural differences can improve efficiency In a recent study by mckinley culture and trust was rated as the fourth top concern of Chinese firms in african For African leaders cultural barriers is rated the second top concern when dealing with Chinese investors It is vital to overcome these challenges with strong communications and a focus on how staff from different backgrounds can most effectively work together Possible solutions include Ensuring compliance with the legislation specific to each country for working hours overtime paid leave and public holidays investing in English or local language classes for Chinese staff investing in Chinese language classes for local management staff incorporating a number of Chinese and local cultural activities and celebrations into the annual calendar of the company i Preparing Chinese staff for cultural differences including in work culture and skills proficiency Investors should empower women with equal access to opportunities and equal pay Women s economic empowerment boosts productivity increases economic diversification and income equality and has trickle down benefits to the wider community As women bear a disproportionate amount of the burden for childcare the economic empowerment of women has a significant impact on the education levels of their children thereby helping to enhance local economic development prospects Provide appropriate risk management and facilities for pregnant and lactating women Women who are pregnant have given birth within the past six months or are breastfeeding are vulnerable to specific risk and may require special considerations beyond the national legislation discussed in Chapter 2. The employer should take into account any risks identified in their workplace and aim to take the necessary measures to remove reduce or control the risk Promote education and child care Employers can support initiatives to promote education and child care for workers children For instance employers can provide direct support to establish nursing centres for mothers with small children Beyond this employers can collaborate with local child care services to cover day care services for workers children This approach benefits workers with children and contributes to create opportunities for women in the formal labour market Without access to free or child care programmes many women with children face barriers to access formal work opportunities Promote health care Even in countries where healthcare is universally provided by the state or available at very low costs for workers payments to cover medications and treatments represent a challenge for most people Their inability to cover such treatments and access adequate medical healthcare directly impacts workers productivity and wellbeing at home and in the workplace Possible solutions that employers can adopt to overcome these challenges are Providing direct support to workers to cover costs of medical treatment Providing health insurance to workers and their families Collaborating with local health centres and nos acting in the region to provide medications and treatments at an accessible price Promote womens health Particularly where the majority of the workforce are young women and the factory is situated far away from health centres Aim to collaborate with local community health centres or with local nos to provide basic services Work with such partners to make contraceptives and vaccines available at the factory Disability inclusion can also generate substantial benefits for employers and communities Persons with disabilities are often marginalized but can add great value to businesses and the economy when given the right opportunity Implement an equal opportunities policy and consider a proactive approach to employing people with disabilities for appropriate roles Consider how best to enhance accessibility to from and around the workplace ok 0 Investing in local skills and Be managers Developing local talent and supporting employee growth is crucial to build workforce capacities and ensure mutually beneficial business growth These practices can ensure that the investing company retains positive relations with the local community and its workforce and helps develop the local economy which in turn will support the investing company as well Provide apprenticeship and training initiatives for youth Develop the skills of young people for their inclusion in the job market This enables companies to diversify their workforce while contributing to transferring knowledge from experienced workers to trainees Provide clear career progression Employers can increasing proficiency in skills and management expertise with higher salaries and increased responsibility local management staff It is important to ensure that there is a prominent role for local management staff members This will help to create a working environment with more integration and understanding between Chinese and local staff and can serve as role models for more junior local staff Additional training to develop skills Employers should consider providing and covering the costs of additional training to staff and managers to help build skills and competence This could include driving lessons to obtain a license language lessons and management training Additional qualifications Employers can consider helping promising management staff the opportunity to achieve additional technical or university qualifications via financial support or providing sufficient time off to study i Building the skills and 8 8 capacity of local farmer vam companies Foreign investors can play a valuable role in developing the skills and technologies of local business through different measures such as Where appropriate investors should consider how partnerships can help to transfer skills and technology in the case of a joint venture or official partnership consider how a structured approach may maximize skills and technology transfer to the local partner Ensure fair payment terms and speedy payment for goods or services procured especially from local companies in cases where there may be disputes consider alternative dispute resolution including negotiations conciliation mediation and arbitration ON Communications and public relations Positive and proactive engagement with the local community in which the investor is operating is crucial to establish and maintain strong communication channels Investing companies are often perceived to be closed to community dialogue so it is important to counter this perception with genuine outreach and a mechanism to address concerns Carry out independent due diligence and consultation when preparing to invest in an area Sometimes governments will bypass local concerns Don t be tempted to take what seems like the easiest approach Investigate local concerns Follow the principle of free prior and informed consent EIC refers to the right of local communities particularly indigenous peoples to participate in decision making about issues affecting them Disclose the economic social and environmental impacts that may or have already resulted from investment decisions Full disclosure to community of plans and mitigating measures is advised Enable and respond to feedback Develop and enable channels for local communities to register grievances and establish systems to address them appropriately and ensure that the project s implementation and future operations consider stakeholders concerns Manage expectations Investors often face complex and high expectations from local communities and nos that believe a company has endless resources with which to offer development benefits It is very important to manage expectations while offering for explaining tangible benefits that are feasible for Share the positive news particularly with local stakeholders Publicize activities where appropriate so that the impact is known by the public and by customers At the same time do not engage in or claiming sustainable actions without merit in order to give the perception of a socially and environmentally conscious company Seek interaction with different stakeholders If community relations are a challenge refer the issues to different stakeholders including local or national governments and seek assistance rather than letting the problem grow There is a risk that companies see everyone as a problem rather than seeking appropriate guidance Stick to what the business license allows Investors should follow their stated intentions for which the environmental license was granted If an approach needs to change ensure the community is aware and understands the rationale Corporate social ro responsibility strategy As discussed in Chapter i this handbook defines car as additional activities that a company can choose to implement beyond core business operations Develop a car initiative based on what is most needed by a community identify key national and local development issues and how they may match the company strengths and the interests of local communities Develop partnerships to increase impact Communicate with other investors companies and development partners about infrastructure that would strengthen the sector What initiatives could be explored Monitor and evaluate the impact of car activities On a regular basis monitor the implementation of car activities in order to capture their outcomes and impact on beneficiary communities This enables businesses to evaluate their relevance and effectiveness in comparison to the initial activity design I Advice from local governments Local governments across Africa often have dedicated units that are able to provide background context or suggestions to investors on more sustainable production processes or business approaches within the context of their specific region In ethiopian for instance a dedicated sustainability unit is likely to be set up within the Ethiopian Investment Commission from 2020. Factors to be consulted with local institutions include location selection to maximize sustainable outcomes Sustainable production techniques Where to source raw materials i supply chains linking to value chains Circular economy opportunities including with other businesses Resilience to the impacts of climate change evident now and likely in the future Engaging with the local up business community companies are encouraged to look beyond Chinese business associations and to engage more with local chambers of commerce and business associations Chambers of commerce provide valuable fora to share information meet new contacts and identify potential business linkages for example suppliers of raw materials Interviews carried out with national chambers of commerce during the preparation of this handbook indicated that they are interested in welcoming more companies as members to help support and enrich local and other international businesses In ethiopian one of the key significant chambers of commerce is the Ethiopian Chamber of Commerce and pectoral association website com email it phone address Ethiopian Chamber of Commerce pectoral Associations building i floor Mexico square adds baba Closing strategy aligned with sustainability In the event of investors closing their operations in ethiopian it is important to fully identify the likely impacts on staff and stakeholders and to address them appropriately Below are some of the key considerations for closing or decommissioning a business Follow the necessary enterprise registration process and ensure that all important assets and documentation are protected Communicate effectively with employees trade unions and stakeholders so that the reasons for closure the process and timeframe are fully understood This will help avoid employee and community dissatisfaction and potential unrest Treat employees according to their rights and best interests and properly handle employee compensation As set out in Chapter i where the exit involves plant closure and land use exit commission an accredited specialist to prepare a decommissioning plan to be approved by the relevant environmental authority Implement the necessary environmental mediation to the site as it is being closed down Comply with the relevant environmental legislation relating to pollution biodiversity and land rehabilitation Consult with community groups that may be impacted by potential closure and provide appropriate compensation if necessary In the case of bankruptcy ensure that the national regulations and requirements are understood and complied with relating to project dissolution and bankruptcy filing In the case of selling the business to other investors ensure that labour and environmental practices are communicated to the new business owner Consider carrying out a evaluation whereby the causes for project success or failure are assessed and lessons learned can be captured and fed into subsequent projects helping to improve sustainability and the chances of success BOX i Chinese sustainability guidelines developed for Chinese companies working abroad Guidance for Chinese Textile and Apparel Industry on Responsible Overseas Investment Developed by the China National Textile and Apparel Council with support from the German Corporation for International cooperation This is also a voluntary standard English version hit orgy Uploads File 2019 06 06 u5ci88657e4cc. edf Chinese version hit orgy Uploads File 2019 06 06 u5c 8867280dfe. edf Guidelines for Environmental Protection in Foreign Investment and cooperation 2013.
