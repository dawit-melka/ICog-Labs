Growth is expected to continue at a rapid pace although forecasts suggest that it will moderate to just over over the next five years These growth rates are the fruit of years of investment and reform that have seen the country entrench economic social and political stability Prior to 2004 the economy was extremely volatile experiencing violent contractions in 1985 1992 1998 and 2003 with a milder recession in 1989. Economic vulnerability was driven by an unfortunate blend of unfavourable weather conditions armed conflict and policy that undermined access to food The result was a series of famines the worst of which made world headlines in 1985. Ethiopia has historically experienced severe droughts more or less once every ten years drought combined with poor farming practices including almost total dependence on rained agriculture has certainly contributed to negative economic growth in Ethiopia in the past but conflict government policy inhibiting access to food and the excessive dependence of the whole economy on agriculture have been far more important drivers Many potential investors eager to avail themselves of the rich opportunities that Ethiopia now offers will want to reassure themselves that past threats to the country economic and political stability belong firmly in the past and that solid measures have been put in place to mitigate these risks in the future 20 7 15 A oH ind TET Famine 5 Drought 5 A Attempted Coup 10 A War Sustainable Plan for Accelerated 15 4 Development and and Sustainable Regime Change Poverty Reduction Development to End 1 Programme Poverty PASDEP 1 SDPRP 20 Civil war in imf data World Economic outlook October 2013 Figure Understanding economic drivers 1980 2018 Ethiopia A growth miracle After more than two decades of civil war the effects of which were exacerbated by international conflicts with somalian 1977 and 1998 and Eritrea 1999 Ethiopia has now enjoyed more than a decade of peace The ruling Ethiopian Peoples Revolutionary Democratic Front EPRDF a coalition of former rebel groups that overthrew the here s military dictatorship in 1991 commands almost total hegemony Ethiopia is a multiparty democracy but in practice there is little opposition to the EPRDF which won more than 90 of the vote in the 2010 elections up from just under 60 in 2005. The strength of this mandate has certainly helped to make it possible for the Ethiopian state to deliver the economic results the country so badly needs yielding success where a weaker state might have failed given the odds The death of miles ienai in 2012 first elected as prime minister in 1995 and who effectively led the country for more than twenty years has created some uncertainty over who will lead the coalition after the federal elections scheduled for 2015. It is not a given that Acting Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn will be put forward as the prof candidate however the consensus is that political stability in the form of a strong coalition government led by the EPRDF will prevail big 209 be 107 Currency stability and exchange rate policy The National Bank of Ethiopia operates a managed float and has a policy of gradual depreciation of the bird which is not freely convertible with occasional sharper adjustments reflecting changes in the parallel market Ethiopia was granted debt relief under the Highly Indebted Poor Countries HIPC initiative in 2001. This provided considerable support to the balance of payments until 2011 but the overall cost of servicing foreign debt quadrupled between 2009 and 2012 In keeping with the primary goal of poverty alleviating the government prefers to use foreign exchange reserves to help fund development programmes Due to this foreign reserves are not expected to exceed three months of import cover and tend to be a bit lower Relatively low reserves and the trade deficit have created downward pressure on the bird for some time a trend that is expected to persist however thanks to the central bank policy of a managed float the volatility of the bird tends to be low particularly for an emerging market currency Exchange controls are strict but processes are in place to help foreign investors satisfy their needs for foreign currency New technology to speed up inter bank processing Swiss based bac Banking Technologies has been selected by Eth Switch sci a consortium of all sixteen Ethiopian banks to implement an electronic transfer system that will enable electronic transfers between banks clearing of cheques and sharing of automated teller machines ATMs . It will take a year to implement the project which will mark a major milestone in the journey towards an efficient modern banking system Credit cards become more widely available as the banking system matures The banking system in Ethiopia is developing quickly One indication of this is the availability of internationally recognised credit cards such as Visa and mastercard Visa cards are now available through two leading Ethiopian banks the Commercial Bank of Ethiopia and dashed bank Until recently dashed Bank was the only Ethiopian bank to distribute mastercard but in March 2014 Awash International Bank naib announced a partnership with Mastercard international total debt service of exports Dabt servos on foreign debt us my right axis Total debt service 3 of unit uss biomass banks total resstves. rate bird USS have Figure Debt service has increased but is sustainable Figure Exchange rate foreign reserves and the current account Banks in ocd countries typically use interest rates as a mechanism for managing inflation price stability being their primary mandate Capital markets in Ethiopia are still under development This makes it difficult to use interest rates as a tool for managing inflation which has reached double digits in six years out of the last ten Although the depreciation of the bird has contributed to price spikes the main driver has been food prices Poor harvests lead to domestic food shortages which in turn cause local prices to rise At the same time an increased need for food imports exposes consumers to volatile international food prices Basic food imports US my right axis International food prices annual change on inflation annual change us 500 Figure Food prices and food imports as inflation drivers 6 Dependence on agriculture has decreased significantly since the 1980s falling from 56 to 46 of gap This still makes the sector far more dominant than is usual elsewhere in Sub Saharan african The change in structure has emerged due to the growth in services driven by an increase in financial intermediation public administration and retail trade rather than the growth that was hoped for in industry and specifically manufacturing As a results more measures to support the growth of industry and especially manufacturing have been put in place and there are indications that manufacturing is beginning to expand even though it is too early for the changes to be reflected in the national accountsTM. Ethiopia leverage its natural resource advantage by creating fertiliser industry Ethiopia has the third largest potassium deposit in the world A recent deal signed with Israeli Chemicals Limited ICL Africa will see the development of Ethiopian allan potash Danakhil deposit expected to produce one million tonnes of potash per years This will help to introduce the new fertiliser to farmers in ethiopian boosting yields and introducing a new product for export The Allana ICL partnership has already invested US 25 million of a planned USS 642 million total investment The expansion of mining activity will also contribute to reducing ethiopians dependence on agriculture In 2012 mining contributed 1.6 to gap and just under 10 to export revenues The 2009 10 Growth and Transformation Plan aims to see this contribution increase to 10 of national output Until recently little had been invested in mapping the country mineral resources but the last decade has seen intensifying interest from global mining companies such as valet bop billion and Petronas to name but a few New investment has resulted in fresh discoveries of gold tantalum and potash reserves In 2008 that the government began exporting opals of which Ethiopia is now the second largest producer in the world agriculture share of gap has not altered much but the composition of agricultural output has changed as dramatically as its overall value has increased This growth has been achieved by expanding the area of land under cultivation rather than by increasing productivity which remains low It is a problem that could and should be addressed and solving it is core to the current Growth and Transformation plan For instance the use of fertiliser is still limited even if imports of fertiliser increased from less than US 50 000 in 2001 to nearly US 630 000 in 2012 and dependence on rained agriculture is still high The African Development Bank estimates that a change in average annual rainfall results in a 0.3 change in gap growth the following years reflecting the impact that changes to farming techniques could have on the economy 14 0 Manufacturing 12 0 Other industry .

Evolution of the Ethiopian economy Figure Evolution of agricultural output fuss million Changes in the composition of agricultural output are also reflected in the pattern of exports which has seen the emergence of totally new categories in the top ten goods For example exports of cut flowers and fresh vegetables were practically nonexistent in 2003 but figured in the top five exports by 2012 together making up one quarter of all exports Although coffee is for the moment still the cornerstone of exports its share of the total is gradually decreasing The strategy of diversification and focus on comparative advantage are paying off Over the same decade that has seen the birds value relative to the dollar halved exports have expanded tenfold in US dollar terms Effective partnerships led to the birth of rose farming in ethiopian along with its twin a functional cold chain The Ethiopian flower industry simply did not exist until 2005. today Ethiopia is the worlds second largest supplier of roses which make up the lion s share of cut flower production as well as 13 of exports worth over US 500 million in 2012 and still growing fast The sector employs 85 000 workers mainly women on more than 100 farms The story of ethiopians roses illustrates how effective partnership between donors the private sector and government can be The Ethiopian government provided generous incentives to attract investors made state owned land available at affordable prices dose to hole International airport and initiated discussions between producers and Ethiopian airlines who leases cargo planes to the industry The Dutch government provided private sector investment grants to partnerships between Dutch companies and Ethiopian producers who had also formed the Ethiopia Horticultural Producers and Exporters Association EHPEA to promote the sector The birth of Ethiopian rose farming has also served to generate a functional cold chain 8 Over the last decades investment

Although these achievements are impressive when measured as a proportion of the population it is clear that much more remains to be done Outcomes with respect to education are less clear The number of pupils in primary education doubled between 2002 and 2012 and increased by 179 in secondary education But proportionately fewer students actually complete primary school and the ratio of pupils to teachers an indicator of the quality of education has worsened This has happened despite consistent investment into training more teachers suggesting that once trained teachers might be attracted away from education to other sectors a problem that is not peculiar to Ethiopia by any means With respect to higher education both the number of graduates and the number of institutions have increased by 2009 10 there were 200 000 students in total including those enrolled in both undergraduates and postgraduate courses By way of comparison this is proportionately twice the number enrolled in universities in Kenya in 2012 Indicator MeasureLife expectancy at birth Years 48 54 62 Under 5 mortality rate Per 1 000 live births 1995Infant mortality rate Per 1 000 live births Children years immunized against measles 12 30 57 to deaths per year mid point Per 100000 population Prevalence of hive of population ages Health expenditure per capita pop Constant 2005 international no a 23.93 51.96 notes 1 World Bank World Development indicators 2 Millennium Development Goals indicators no a not available Table Selected health indicators not of teachers in primary thousands 68.4 259.6 2704 not of teachers in secondary thousands 23.7 no a 122.2 not of pupils in primary millions  not of pupils in secondary millions  pupils teacher ratio in primary units 30 no a 54 pupils teacher ratio in secondary units 33 no a 40 Pupils starting grade 1 who reach last grade 233 51 414 of primary Education expenditure Current uss notes 1 World Bank World Development indicators 2 Millennium Development Goals indicators no a not available Table Selected education indicators In recent years Ethiopia has made significant progress in infrastructure and its infrastructure indicators compare relatively well with low income country peers The country developed Ethiopia Airlines know one of the three main African airlines and associated regional air transport hubs It has launched an ambitious investment program to upgrade its network of trunk roads and is establishing a modern funding mechanism for road maintenance Access to water and sanitation is expanding rapidly from a very low based thanks to judicious concentration on intermediate options such as traditional latrines wells borehole and standposts. Africa Infrastructure Country Diagnostic Although only 23 of Ethiopians had access to grid electricity in 2010 power production has increased steadily over the last ten years and is almost exclusively sourced from clean energy in the form of hydropower stations Ethiopia has the second largest hydropower potential in african after the Democratic Republic of the Congo and is already starting to implement its goal of becoming a major exporter of electricity in the region Net potential exports could reach 26.3 two per years bringing in uss 263 which is equivalent to about of gap The investment needed to make this happen is being sourced through a variety of channels including domestic bonds and foreign investment from the private sector New hydroplane constructed in the last ten years include tepee 300 we completed in 2009 ginger give II 420 we and Tana believe 460 we Completion of the Grand Renaissance Dam will see the existing capacity of 2 000 my quadruple changing the face of East African power infrastructure forever Improved access to water and water storage has been achieved by implementing a range of solutions from rainwater harvesting to hand dug wells to large scale irrigation schemes The housing stock has been increased with 213 000 units built during the passed period leading to new enterprise and job creation The expansion of the construction industry has seen imports of inputs capital goods and materials increase pending the development of domestic supply Until 2010 investment in roads equivalent to around of gap per year focused on upgrading and rehabilitating the trunk road system however only 10 of ethiopians rural population live within two kilometres of an all weather road a serious challenge considering that 76 of the total population lives in rural areas Solving this problem completely would require tripling the length of the road network and so the strategy is to prioritise areas with high agricultural potential in order to improve food security however the construction of a 5 000km long railway network is now being implemented by the Ethiopian Railways corporation Although the immediate priority is to get the line between addis ababa and Djibouti Port up and running an achievement that will slash the current cost of international freight ultimately the network is expected to reach every corner of the country 6000 5000 Millions of we 4.000 3000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2008 2007 Electricity production kvh Electric power consumption kwh 2008 2008 2010 him Figure 11 Electricity supply and demand this years Road construction leads to new manufacturing plant Israeli firm AnyWay Solid Environmental Solution first participated in a road building project in Ethiopia seven years ago The company produces an environmentally friendly chemical product used to convert poor quality soil into a strong impermeable layer Stabilised earth block construction is also used as an innovative cost effective method for building low cost housing As anyways business in Ethiopia expanded they reached the conclusion that they needed to produce their product locally and have set the wheels in motion to establish a manufacturing plant that they hope will enter production later 15 The transformation of addis ababa into a regional hub for air transportation through the upgrading of hole International Airport and launch of Ethiopian Airlines has been a major success for ethiopian The airline is now one of the top three in Africa and is expanding fast Ethiopian Airlines growing by 25 per year Founded in 1945 Ethiopian Airlines is one of african big success stories and has won numerous international awards over the years including repeated recognition as the best airline in african In 2011 it became the third African member of Star Alliance after egyptian and South African Airways and currently has code share agreements with 15 other international airlines as well as strategic partnerships with West African ask airlines and malaria airlines as part of its plan to create multiple hubs in the region Ethiopian Airlines has grown rapidly over the last ten years and provides a valuable underpinning to the expansion of Ethiopian international trade and relations acting as a catalyst to adds abbas emergence as a regional and even global hub As well as services to 17 domestic destinations the airline now offers flights to 80 international destinations the most recent addition being shanghai Since 2003 the number of passengers has quadrupled increasing from 1.12m to 4.64m.

strategic advantage with the United states which views it as a key ally At the same time Chinese influence has strengthened over the years with increasing trade and extensive aid Chinese companies have invested in infrastructure projects but also in light manufacturing focusing on sectors that are being prioritized by the Ethiopian government such as leather and textiles Ties with most of ethiopian neighbours have strengthened too thanks to the country participation in multilateral organisations such as the amish peacekeeping mission in somalian and the proposed African Mechanism for Police Co operation Crossborder infrastructure programmes have also served to strengthen links These include a water pipeline to Djibouti as well as the implementation of ethiopians hydropower

over the last fifteen years in terms of macroeconomic stability growth the development of hard and soft infrastructure reducing poverty and improving the quality of life of ordinary Ethiopians have contributed to creating the enabling environment that business whether domestically owned or foreign needs to thrive and prosper This environment is still a work in progress and the investments planned in the framework of the current Growth and Transformation Plan 2010 11 2014 15 are designed to stimulate further success while in many cases they embody business opportunities meanwhile investors from a wide range of countries have already set up operations spanning a variety of sectors Some of these investments have already changed the structure of Ethiopian exports others will gradually change the very structure of the economy as the manufacturing sector matures ethiopians growth miracle has been less a miracle than the result of persistence and dogged determination to address poverty in measurable and meaningful ways by creating the hard and soft infrastructure that will enable business success by playing better to the country comparative advantages in trade and by ensuring both political and macroeconomic stability In short the factors underlying ethiopians stellar growth record have been simple but setting them in place represents an extraordinary achievement
