1. Executive Summary
Executive Summary
The leather sector is one of the priority sectors identified by the government, strictly following the value addition policy that the government has put in place for the manufacturing sector as a whole.
Following the various value addition policy changes over the years, the sectors competitiveness has experienced variable growth and decline periods, culminating in export value earnings not reaching
targets. Such significant policy changes require time for the industry, as a whole, to fully adopt and adapt to, from all facets of the leather business and its value chain.
Consequently, the poor export performance has necessitated in relevant government bodies (MOTI/LIDI, EIC) in partnership with Enterprise Partners to agree to explore the leather sector with a view
to understanding its current global market position and the challenges it currently faces, ultimately generating recommendations for bold measures towards improving its competitiveness and overall
performance.
It is essential to understand and embrace the sectors performance against the evolving drivers dictated by the global leather market. Of particular note is an increased impetus relating to environmental
aspects, addressing the scope of sustainability and understanding modern social compliance pressures. Accordingly, the sector must look to significantly advance, becoming more efficient and
embracing environmental based criteria. Leather chemical manufacturers are a major source of assistance, and continue to develop cleaner technologies that tackle environmental pressures.
Ethiopian manufacturers, in general, have not evolved, nor fully understood, the increased quality assurance and compliance requirements of the global market. The government has opened up the
sector to foreign investment (starting 2009), which has attracted more than fifteen FDI tanneries, yet only four footwear manufacturing factories.
The challenges faced are at both the macro/structural and micro level (essentially factory level), including severe shortages of accessible foreign currency, continued raw material (RHS) quality
deterioration, weak modern production management systems and the absence of an efficiently functioning ecosystem (input supply market, logistics, workforce development, etc).
If captured correctly, there is an immense opportunity that the Ethiopian leather sector can tap into, with key points noted:
e Shift sectors positioning in the global market, through better understanding of global requirements and customer needs
e Target and improve raw material quality and availability, recognizing it is an essential primary input
 Advance and streamline processes and operations to realize overall improved profitability and efficiency
e Embrace and adopt environmental, sustainability and social standards that are desired by export markets
Attract and incentivize good quality FDIs whom are focused on final product manufacturing to further develop the entire leather value chain
e Overhaul support institutions to ensure they offer genuine, real-time knowledge and assistance to the industry as a whole
The reality is simply that to implement all of these changes shall require commitment, investment and an enabling-environment for business to be forged within, with said ecosystem functioning to
create positive and progressive interactions that both encourage and facilitate manufacturing.
Coordination, structure and collaboration is critical in order to deliver on the set of recommendations proposed in this roadmap, where improvements need to be addressed and introduced by all
stakeholders within the industry. The value chain is only as strong as its weakest link, and issues can ultimately wreak havoc causing lost profitability and revenue generation.
Benchmarked countries have put in place the required attributes required to supply the global market, and these efforts are yielding true business value to all stakeholders. But they are also constantly
evolving and adapting to the ever-changing landscape of trade around the globe. Business sectors must not view this as a challenge, but more of an opportunity for success.
It is apparent that bold and drastic reforms are required to incentivize and reboot the industry  it is extremely important to be mindful that industries need time to adapt to significant changes and
requirements needed to position itself correctly, and with confidence, in the global market. Consequently, such changes introduced require adequate time to become fully effective and in order to
sustain the gain they will bring, building a reliable and robust business platform.

Note: Due to time shortages, the team was not able to travel to the additional 2 countries as initially planned. As a result, desktop reviews were carried out in order to benchmark agreed upon focus
areas and parameters
Scope of work
* Value chain limitation-from abattoir to end consumer; additional work needs to be carried out in the handling of livestock and related scope. In order for the sector to experience the
initially discussed, strong growth considerable work has to be carried out at the animal husbandry and handling stage.
* Nature of document as a roadmap requires that additional work be carried out by stakeholders in order to develop budget estimations and agree on time-line. Related figures (if any)
contained in this document are estimations based on reasonable assumptions and leading practices. It is assumed that owning bodies, will develop relevant action plans aligned to
the agreed upon findings once the document has been accepted as final.
Company specific data
1. Although considered beneficial to the study, the team was not able to obtain certain company specific data. These include production cost breakdown, salary figures, realistic
production figures. Where data is severely lacking the Consultants and Experts that make up the study team have worked with what was available to them plus expert assumptions.
 Data related to environmental assessment was perceived to be a very sensitive and highly confidential issue. Participating companies have expressed concern in submitting such data.
As a result, most of the information filled appeared scattered and unrealistic. The Consultants and Experts relied on anonymous data provided from LIDI.
 The study team asserts that company data should be taken as indicative. Additional and in-depth studies or validation data by relevant document owner is recommended prior to
making any decisions.
Quality of data
e Consultants and Experts of the study team relied heavily on published reports and data provided by various stakeholders (government institutions, development partners, private
companies). Under the current scope of work, it is not the responsibility of the study team to validate such data and reports beyond cross-checking against existing documents and
data sets. Furthermore, the study team assumes data is complete once received.
Recommendations
* The recommendations enclosed have been developed in order to address the key questions that have driven the content of the document. While developing these recommendations,
the team has found certain themes to be prevalent throughout a series of strategies and documents developed by various development partners and stakeholders. Where necessary
some of the recommendations in this document build on existing ones. The team asserts that this may lead to increased collaboration, optimization of budgets.
* As per the original scope of work, the recommendation and roadmap framework has been developed with sufficient level of specificity to allow the receiving and implementing bodies
and partners to capitalize upon.
Success of recommendations and targets
* The enclosed document contains findings based on various primary and secondary resources. Throughout the document development, relevant stakeholders have been consulted to
ensure alignment on key findings and recommendations, thereby creating buy-in. Following finalization of this document, it shall not be the responsibility of the team that has prepared
the document to ensure successful outcome of the recommendations or targets.

e Creation of a cache (e. g. made in Italy) that is built around consistent production processes, focus on quality, pricing etc. can provide edge
against growing competition.
e High value producers import raw hides and semi processed leather before finishing and adding value. It is known that Ethiopia has put a
restrictive export tax on semi-processed leather which took out this potential market stream.

India managed to overcome the challenges of the value added export policy through integrated
and coordinated interventions across the private and public continuum
Analysis of leather sector in India Lessons learned for Ethiopia
of value-added
exports
e Indian government followed value addition policy in the
1970/80s and banned exports of raw hides and skins.
* The policy Shift resulted in a dip in exports performance in
the early years; which was a natural phenomenon as the
industry had to learn adding value and operate in a different
market.
* The dip in exports stayed for only four years (1980 to
1983).
* The export declined by 23% in 1981, and slowly picked
up after 1984 and reached 34% growth by 1987.
e The government support institutions and private sector
worked together in supporting the industry grow holistically
(i. e. managed to integrate products). The establishment
of CLRI in 1967 and FDDI in 1988 played a key role in
institutionalizing the support structure.
Research and training institutions played big part on
technology and technical support while the government
had incentive packages including duty drawback and export
rebates.
Since India is a large country, the cluster approach helped
in paving the way input providers, support institutions and
treatment plants are spread across the country.
Most product manufacturers are also located with in these
clusters but also in the villages in which labor availability is
ensured with out relocating the workers.
* Ethiopia has been facing similar challenges in its ex
performance as a result of the policy shift to export of
value added leather products.
Key lessons
Putting in place an integrated, multifaceted approach from
key public and private actor to lay the ground to fast track
the sector's learning curve.
GoE to integrate and mainstream initiatives by private and
public bodies across the value chain.
To ensure the national level marketing of Ethiopian leather
is strengthened to ensure sustainable brand relationship and
technology/knowledge transfer
Strong policies on finance, access to inputs, logistics and
other support functions to ensure fast tracked production
and export.
Need for ensuring a well trained human capital base through
the strengthening of public and in-house training facilities.
* Cluster approach  Push on Modjo leather city for tanning
and development of dedicated IPs.
Product factories need to account for labor access and port
access (for speed to market).

Key drivers of growth in the Vietnamese leather sector development were evolving industrial
policy and FDI promotion
Analysis of leather sector in Vietnam
* [n 2001, the Strategy for Acceleration of Socialist-oriented
Industrialization to modernize the country by 2020 was
launched. As part of the strategy, thirteen industries to reach
the 2020 target were selected; among them were leather and
footwear sector.
The strategy seeks to mobilize all possible resources to achieve
a rapid and effective development of products, sectors and
industries that have comparative advantages in order to
basically meet domestic demand and promote exports.
Key strategies of FDI promotion in Vietnam include: (i) the use
h of proper policies to support FDI promotion; (ii) greater focus
Industrial on establishing a liberal neutral environment; (iii) provision of
Policy and necessary conditions for the effective decentralization of FDI
management; (iv) promotion of supporting industries; and (v)
FDI Promotion closer consultation with existing and potential investors.
* Policy measures that were undertaken to improve and support
FDI were:
* The foreign investment law has undergone four revisions
in 1990,1992, 1996 &2000 to improve registration
procedures and the decentralization of investment
licensing to land access, trade policy, foreign exchange
control, and tax policies.
e [n 2005 the law was improved further to simplify the
registration procedures for foreign investments.
* Vietnam also employed a pro-active open-door policy
and embarked on increased global economic integration
to facilitate trade and FDI.
 Focused and strategic promotion of the investment pote
in the country to attract more FDI in the sector.
* Continuous coordination and consultation platforms with
current investors to identify and tackle issues in a sustainable
manner.

good-income consumers and preference for unusual products.
This is the long-term development trend of the Vietnamese
leather and footwear industry in the next 15-20 years.
* As the R&D in Ethiopia is in its early stages especially in the
private sector, linking the industry actors to R&D product
development and other facilities in the international arena

in the registered slaughter establishments is 60 million heads of cattle annually
Analysis of leather sector in Brazil
Animal husbandry conditions: mandatory identification, recording and reporting of
individual cattle
Livestock Branding:
e System of Identification and Certification of Origin for Bovine and Buffalo (SISBOV)
is the official system of animal identification in Brazil, designed to identify animal
source (domestic or imported)
e The system, which is based on ear tags, matches the ear tags with individual animal
certificates. The certificates, which are required if an animal moves to another
premises, is a certification registered with the state government. The identification
and certification procedures are done by private companies that have been
contracted through the government.
Pre-slaughter
Slaughterhouse conditions & Flaying techniques:
conditions * People kill nearly 300 million beef cattle annually worldwide and Brazil is with
the second largest rate with a kill rate of 43 Millions of cattle per year as of 2012.
In 2010, the annual slaughter volume in Brazil has reached 60 million head of
cattle including establishments registered with the Federal Inspection Service (FIS),
the State Inspection Service (SIE) and the Municipal Inspection Service (MIS).
 With the slaughter of 43 million head in 2010, Brazil used 71% of its installed
beef slaughter capacity. Slaughter levels in Brazil are rising due to strong domestic
demand and improved export to non-traditional markets.
Hide and skin grading:
e Brazilian government, by 2002, made a first attempt to create a national grading
system for bovine raw hide.
e A research conducted by the Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation,
EMBRAPA, suggested some improvements to the system and recommends the
pursuing of automation to increase reliability using standard techniques, like
color-based models and co-occurrence matrix-based texture analysis.
e Brazil is working to develop a completely automated system, based on computer
vision, for bovine raw hide and leather classification and grading.
* The need for strengthening animal "
husbandry and pre slaughter conditions
in the country.
The certification and origin registration
system in commercial farms need to be
out in place.
The need to capacitate slaughterhouses
with skilled personnel and equipment to
ensure quality RHS.
Enforcement of the national RHS grading
and marketing is essential to ensure RHS

factors
* Brazil does not prohibit exports of leather. There is, however,
the export duty for some types of leather.
Government e Exports of bovine raw hides, skins and wet-blue are subject
to export duty of 9%.
e Crust and semi processed leathers are not subject to export
duty.
policy
* Base [thiopias national leather marketing strategy on
strategical selected social and cultural elements and build an
acceptable brand.
The free range approach to cattle rearing can be adopted
to Ethiopia since the majority of cattle graze freely and
commercial ranching accounts for very small component if
the national livestock production.
The Ethiopian government can go back and consider
export of RHS( either pickle or Wet blue) to make sure

destinations from European countries to Asian countries. Before the export tax, the main importers were Italy
and the United Kingdom; after the export tax, exports diverted to China, Hong Kong, and India.

Aggregation of RHS is cumbersome due to numerous producers and players active in distribution
Live animal Value Chain in Ethiopia
La
 EE
e Several value chain actors and stakeholders actively involved in the trade of live animals
e Large traders become involved in the secondary market. Between 500 and 1000 shoats and ~250 cattle are sold at these markets
Terminal markets are typically urban areas, largely Addis Ababa
e Trade volumes in the domestic market are driven largely by holidays and religious influences. During these periods, quantity of livestock traded may increase by 3 times
Export market served by only two actors, in contrast to the domestic market in which there appears to be seven channels of live animal movement
Export market is highly contingent upon demand generated by the Middle East as well as ability of the slaughterhouse to meet hygiene, safety and customer requirements
* Less than 3% of total livestock is traded for meat and live export
~40% of livestock is delivered for backyard slaughtering leading to significant loss in supply of
RHS for tanning and finished products
S/M trader Large trader Abattoir Butcher
 Approximately 97% of meat produced end
up in the domestic market
e Although decrease in backyard slaughter
practices is observed due to urbanization,
increased awareness 40% of livestock
destined for slaughter is carried out in
back yards
e Currently, the two best/most reliable
sources of RHS are through domestic and
export abattoirs (~12%)
Domestic
market (97%)
v
e Ethiopia's competitiveness remains low in the
export market due to market entry restrictions.
e Increased focus on quality of meat through use of
market (3%) feed is imperative to bring about change in the
appearance of hides and skins. This also increases
the acceptance of meat in the export market

There are four major animal husbandry challenges which have a direct impact on RHS as an input
for the leather industry
Animal Husbandry Challenges in Ethiopia

Limited accessibility to health services/vaccinations
Livestock reared largely for farming/ploughing
fattening of small portion coincides with major holidays

Strict veterinary follow up and strong compliance to SPS requirements
Mainly export-oriented
Cattle and shoats selected for export are in prime condition
Impact or risk area affecting RHS as an input
Increased disease pool as well as transmission likelihood, difficulty in
establishing traceability
Shortage in feed affects weight, quality of meat and hide (thinness)
Adverse effect on hides/skins due to poor nutrition and harsh conditions
Parasitic diseases reduce quality of RHS
Hides are marked by yolk lashes, skins affected by parasitic diseases
Inconsistency in supply, price hikes of up to 3x due to fluctuations and
hoarding
Optimal quality of RHS not reached; grain of leather affected
Contributes to less than 1% of total RHS supply
Visible scars and lesions despite improved feed
Positive impact on appearance/quality of RHS
Limited supply base of RHS (driven by abattoir and export market needs)
Desirable RHS
Reduction in parasitic and other skin diseases which affect RHS usability
Sufficient quantities of RHS cannot be sourced from this channel
Only 0.5% of total animals traded will yield RHS as by product through this
chain
Given prevalence of diseases, greatest potential likely to be exploited through increasing holding
areas and commercial feedlots
2 Disease prevalence
and management
Current practice/description Impact or risk area affecting RHS as an input
Major diseases = Tick on tick bone diseases = Holes and unhealed scars in hides visible on grain surface of finished leather
Mange and mites = Small pinholes and scabies on RHS leading to production impediments
Lice = Intense itching and scratching create tough skin and wounds
Keds = Creation of nodules, creation of cockle which reduces skin value; less tensile
Lumpy skin disease (LSD) = Permanent lesions on the skin
Goat and sheep pox = Low healing leading to permanent scars; loss in potential supply
Disease management = Few nationwide campaigns against ecto-parasite and skin diseases = Overall affected quality of RHS as a byproduct
Considerable amount of illegal drugs entering peripheral areas of
country
High recurrent health cost for reducing young stock mortality (89%
and 93%) for cattle and sheep and goats, respectively
Limited access to vaccines and medication for priority diseases
Vaccination campaigns driven largely by outbreak occurrences
Stakeholder coordination = National Skin and Hide Improvement Project aimed at bringing Projects addressing issues related with animal disease have been inconsistent,
and resources holistic improvement at national level through institutional hence persisting problems of quality of RHS
coordination not in effect due to lack of funding/government
endorsement
Transportation, handling, tracebility system as well as human treatment of animals have
challenges affecting RHS as an input
3 Transportation

Pre-loading :
4 Traceability
and humane treatment
Traceability system .
Humane animal treatment .
Current practice
No separation of horned or non-horned animals
Methods of detecting stock diseases visual, no documentation
Trekking main form of transportation for primary producers
No dedicated animal transportation vehicles
Frequent whipping to herd cattle and shoats prior to aggregation
Highly complex market structures with several actors
Limited or no awareness on traceability requirements
Poor enforcement of country traceability system, few grading experts
Vehicles used to transport animals only at secondary and tertiary
markets
Deprivation of water, feed and proper rest areas while trading
Slaughtering systems
= Specific brands caring about animal handling and transportation conditions
prior to slaughter, hence barrier to access specific markets.
= Traceability becomes very difficult, almost impossible
= Limited market access for finished produced manufacturers
= RHS potential remains low
= Long distances travelled
There are four common slaughter methods, two of which are formal and contribute to only 30%
cattle hide and 10% sheep and goat skin supply to tanneries

 Approximately 1% cattle, 12.6% sheep and 8.5% goats are
slaughtered by the livestock holders
* As a result, majority of RHS supplied to tanners are sourced
from non-holders.
* Long-term efforts to increase/improve household animal
handling and slaughtering can bring about a considerable
improvement in supply base for RHS
Skins, where Ethiopian factories have established their competitive advantage, are sourced largely
(~85%) from informal avenues - full economic benefits are not being realized

Veterinary
follow up and
supervision
Most operate below installed capacity.
Largest municipal abattoir (Addis Ababa) has an installed
capacity of 1200 cattle per day and operates at between 37%
and 44% capacity.
Hides and skins still removed by hand from carcass;
appropriate technology does not exist.
Limited training and supervision during removal process.
Low worker incentive leading to poor and haphazard removal
of hides and skins marked by excessive cuts.
Follow up is generally carried out on ante and post mortem
inspection.
Greater focus given to the quality of meat during slaughter
rather than the hides and skins.
Higher rate of supervision takes place for urban
slaughterhouses rather than rural due to higher market size
and large volume of meat.
Improvements in slaughtering and handling of animals can increase the quality of RHS by at least
30%, thereby decreasing the overall cost and increasing product diversity
Main Challenges Affecting RHS Quality

Challenges in slaughtering and handling
* Young slaughter age has a cascade effect on reduced size and
thickness of raw material limiting product diversity
e Remaining animals are killed via non-abattoir routes
heavily compromising quality and instigating complexity.
Non-abattoir routes typically cause an extra ~30% quality
deterioration to RHS
e Export meat market opportunities drive slaughter ages down
Post-mortem handling
e Salt availability and price is challenging collectors and traders
* Numerous post-mortem defects include (putrefaction of skins
and hides before they reach tanneries; heat damage; grain
crack; staining and soiling etc. )
 Reduced quality
* Area losses
e Limited product diversity

Implications
* Challenges in finding chemicals with desired quality,
quantity and price
e Suppliers unable to purchase and store chemicals reflecting
needs of factories, leading to supply shortage
* Financial constraints on suppliers who in turn will not be
able to supply chemicals in a timely manner or purchase
advance stock to meet demand
e Factories are forced to seek alternative sources of chemical
e Final purchase price of chemical supplied through bonded
warehouse is higher than products which are directly
imported
* Factories seeking to use voucher system to gain benefits are
unable to do so because of lengthy time
 Repeated search by customs authority as well as shortage of
inspectors can lead up to 1 week to sell a product to a user
* Long period of time taken to release chemicals despite the

* Overall export of finished leather has been on the decline between * [n 2009/10 sharp drop in finished exports by local tanneries due to shift towards
2012/13 and 2016/17 export of finished leather only.
During this period, drop in exports could be attributed to pre-stock of global buyer in
order to provide Ethiopian tanneries with sufficient time to upgrade technology.
* Financial crisis also caused massive slowdown in purchase of leather.
* 2010/11: although global business environment improved, local tanneries could
provide finished leather to compete on the global platform.
* On the other hand, FDI tanneries showed a very strong leap in performance.
Although volume of exports has not changed significantly, the more concerning trend is the decline
in export dollar value

Environment: Water consumption
Water Consumption
Key Findings
* Variations in water consumption between 15m? /ton to 80m? ton of wet
salted hides and nearly identical results in raw materials of same category.
* Water is drawn largely from rivers, lakes or drilled wells with hardly any
industrial or control flow meters.
* Consumption of water is basically free of charge.
 There were no observed environmental impact assessments required by local
government for water extraction practices, thus there is no measurement of
the impact of the practice on the affected communities and to water supply
in general.
* Global consumption of water is declining (UNIDO benchmark of <25m? /ton
as maximum).
* Moving forwards, water must be classified as an essential process parameter.
* Constraints in assessing water consumption
* Monthly data over at least 6 months required, but only 1 month data
provided by LIDI and virtually no water consumption records kept by
tanneries.
Data record
 No tanneries have flow meters installed and are unable to monitor use of
water
provided by LIDI
* Majority of tanneries have own boreholes ranging in depth from 37m to
135m.
e Pump installed to use water as needed.
* No environmental fee for the use of water and consequential
environmental impact.
* Absence of fee is a lost revenue resource for the government and lacks
any kind of enforcement on the waste and pollution side.

How does Ethiopia perform against the global standards
* No efficient waste management observed
* Leftover cutting and waste from RHS not collected or
disposed of correctly
* Poor cutting techniques meant underutilization of leather and
increased material waste
* Sludge disposal are not sufficient in size resulting in short
time allocated for previous sludge to dry and be disposed of
properly
* Range of sludge is BR 200-500
Improper dumping on landfills in and around Addis Ababa
* No chemical tests available to assess consumption of sludge
* Monthly waste generation ranged from 1.5 tons/month to 500
tons/month
* Waste is not segregated and instead is mixed together.
There are no existing incentives for recycling efforts as no
markets exist. The consequence is that the entire waste load
is dumped in the municipal landfill in the outskirts of Addis
Ababa and Mojo
* Tannery (87%) performance in line with (WG protocol of
between 26.8-160 MJ/m?
How does Ethiopia perform against the global standards In general, although standards were used to develop an assessment of waste generation,
figures submitted by tanneries have made it impossible to generate a solid numerical analysis. Figures submitted do not correspond to the
amount of leather produced. Qualitative assessment/conclusions have been presented above
In summary there are 5 major/core issues which must be tackled conscientiously in order to make
the right impact on industry growth and attainment of export markets

VISION AND STRATEGIC DIRECTION
Vision 2025
Ethiopia would be Africas largest manufacturing hub for leather products, mostly using high quality raw hides and skin and leather produced in
country. This would be achieved by quality FDIs and domestic investors, resulting in export earnings, decent factory job opportunity for youth and
women, and income opportunities for farmers and traders. Ethiopia would achieve this with high standard of environmental and social compliance.

Cross-cutting Functions
Both top-down pull and bottom-up approach needs to be applied to the Ethiopian leather
sector, thus creating an integrated value chain as well as the need to focus on its resource base
Specific Constraint
* Not enough final product manufacturing taking place in the country which brings significantly more value and employment
* Poor and declining raw material  it is a resource based sector for Ethiopia to capitalize on
Context
Ethiopia was not able to build strong and large leather product manufacturers. It also has a declining raw material quality that is also not getting demand in the global market when
transformed by local tanneries. While the amount of investment that is needed to transform leather from raw to finished is significant in comparison from raw to pickle/wet-tanned, the
major financial gain comes from transforming finished leather to final product.
Details of Recommendation
* Consider the release of semi-finished product to the global market [low grade]
e Invest heavily in getting the product manufacturing base (bring the entire value chain within the country)
* MOTI * Countries like India banned semi-processed leather export however has succeeded in creating product manufacturing industry
* Indonesia also has a ban on exporting semi-processed material, and ensures it is consumed within by product manufacturers for
global brands
e [talian manufacturers specializes within clusters
e Brazil supplies all levels of semi-finished leather as well as products to the global market
Input Suplies Production Process Marketing
Restructure the sector and redefine its position in the global leather value chain
DO NOT RESTRICT - INCENTIVIZE!
* Weak competitiveness of the sector internationally (weak positioning) e Low grade materials not being utilized, or are underutilized, within the country (including FDI product
* Local actors dying out  risk of dominance by foreign actors manufacturers)
Not enough product manufacturers to utilize existing leather produced
The sector hasn't seen a significant gain from the value addition policy change. Leather sector and its respective markets are complex and have their own different competitiveness aspects, dominated by leather product type to be
generated. To ask manufacturers to be specialized along the value chain since it is complex and requires huge amount of investment. As an example the cost, complexity and capital investment of machinery to transform RHS into
a finished leather is typically far more than if only processing from RHS through to pickle, and this is exacerbated if low grade material requires major upgrading technology to be employed.
The core of the current policy is beneficial as it fuels the products market in Ethiopia. However, two of the major FDIs supply themselves from their own tannery. At the moment, there is not enough product manufacturers to
consume the finished leather that is being produced by the existing tanneries. For the tanneries to go out and look for finished leather buyers has proved to be a daunting task and not a successful one. Strategic risk to the country
if the leather actors are only going to be FDlIs.
e Put mechanisms in place for exporting low grade materials in semi-processed state as it will be better to at e Ensure that the locally owned tanning industry remains, ensuring the future-
least gain costs for such material rather than it become a burden and ultimately a financial loss proofing of RHS transformation processing of Ethiopian material
 Put incentives to attract product manufacturing in country to absorb local tannery leather production * Allow tanneries to decide how to segment the transformation process which could
provide more focused and specialized production
Ownership Benchmark
* MOTI * Some of the Italian manufacturers specialize within the leather producing clusters
e Brazil has one of the most successful leather industry with their actors doing both semi-finished, finished leather as well as final
* Many tanners in other countries cream off the better material for themselves and sell the lower grades to other tanners around the
world
Production Process
Input Suplies Marketing
Drive real value addition from final product manufacturing not only from finished leather
* Value addition policy is not actually creating value e Pricing of leather exported seems to be varied and have a relatively low selling price
* Weak market access to finished leather due to weak relationships and quality/
price command
Both semi-finished and finished leather are inputs to the leather sector in its entirety. The historical rule of thumb in the leather sector for normal/standard/commodity type finished leather, is that raw material counts for 50 - 60%
of the total finished leather price. This leaves 40  50% for the value addition and the profit margin, but this must be balanced with actual selling price related to cutting yields if the quality is poor. To command a good quality
finished leather requires more machinery, talent and market access. To transform from semi-processed to finished leather requires intensive work for the value it will be bringing. It costs more to upgrade low grade materials  at
it stands now, there is no capacity to invest on the low quality. Leaves us with two options  either (1) find a market for it at a sensible price or (2) find an alternative market in other sectors (pharma and cosmetics/food industry)
which will take the raw material simply as collagen. To be able to complete the entire product manufacturing in Ethiopia, will be fuelling the economy from all the additional activities and employment that product manufacturing
will be creating. This will require the finished leather supply to improve its quality and increase volume, for which further technical improvements need to take effect.
* Strategically incentivizing multiple product manufacturers to relocate to Ethiopia. Instead of targeting existing manufacturers,  Putin place a mechanism by which good, reliable and consistent finishing

leather sector in the country
* MOTI * A number of countries such as Indonesia, India, etc have employed incentives to ensure that final product manufacturing is completed
LIDI in their country that is aligned to ensuring the use of domestically sourced RHS
* Companies such as Devro, have collagen refining facilities located around the globe to access various RHS waste feedstocks
* Less gain  Ethiopia is exporting more than 47% of its finished leather at less ~~  Less value addition by tanneries  hence commanding low price
than USD $1
* Only 15% of Ethiopia's exports brought a price of $2 and above
The low export price performance is despite the countrys value addition policy that is aimed at increasing export earnings from exporting value added products. The restrictive tax policy was also introduced to achieve the same
result. The government needs to closely follow the export performance of this sector and ensure that the country is getting its fair share from the finished products it is shipping, thus ensuring the export products are in no way
being undervalued. It is also important and timely to understand the reasons behind the continuous low export price performance accounting for a significant share of the export volume. Although it is known that price points are
different for different finished leather types, buyers (mostly agents/traders in Ethiopia's case), level of value addition and finish quality/grade selection determine the final negotiated price.
e Ensure the minimum cost of production is covered by the claimed price
e Ensure the right price is being fetched from the raw material used
 Suggest price target ranges for different finished leather categories  this should generate an additional 7 to 10 million
dollars

Introduce floor price mechanism for RHS at production and collection level to incentivise better
collection rate
e Discouraging prices observed in the first level markets leading to lower collection rate overall, in turn causing lower supply to the tanneries.
* Disagreement on grade and origin of RHS supplied.
Currently there is a serious supply-demand scenario occurring, driven primarily through availability and perceived quality of the RHS. Such highs and lows of pricing and availability, which originate at the RHS stage, serve no
benefit to the tanners, whom are unable to pass on regular fluctuating costs in the final leather cost. As such it creates issues where tanners effectively gamble upon raw material inventory, which can cause extreme pressure on
cashflow or potentially having to overprice the final leather as forward cover for high RHS prices, impacting on sales opportunities. If a tanner has no raw material, they have nothing to make leather with.
In addition, it is also known that FDI's are paying higher prices in order to access better quality or larger skins, and thus their purchasing power is causing an imbalance that is effectively penalising the local tanneries.
Through introduction of a more regulated floor price, the RHS sector is incentivised to increase collection rates, and a standardised price will smooth the sale price to tanneries and ensure greater volume-
related opportunity for the country as a whole.
e A floor price mechanism will also incentivise small holder farmers and small traders to seriously consider improved handling of RHS. Small traders will actively become involved in collection of RHS,
ultimately increasing the supply of RHS as opposed to wastage.
* MOTI

Improve RHS management and inspection system
* Poor management of RHS leading to deteriorating grade and quality.
The loss of quality can be directly related in to a $ financial value. Even with crude estimates, it is anticipated that over $10M is lost in export revenue due to quality related issues, whether it be reject skins or just simply large
cutting yield losses. Post-mortem defects can be addressed in the short run which will increase the grade selection, while ante-mortem defects require long term animal husbandry interventions.
Hides and skins extension and regulatory service needs to reinforced led by Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Resources. It needs to carry out regular RHS improvement activity such as: capacity
building and training program for RHS traders, artisans and butchers, provision of inputs such as field vehicles, RHS preparation equipment etc. , and employing RHS technicians and experts working all
over the country. This process will support the increased capability of small holder farmers, RHS small traders and large scale traders to improve the management of RHS leading to quality improvement.
e Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) to be introduced at the abattoir level. Abattoirs should be utilising best practices to ensure the RHS is treated as a valuable by-product. As such an instructional SOP
can be generated to provide sufficient training and quality control checks during the process, in order to yield improved RHS. A quarterly inspection (led be MoA technicians) to be conducted to ensure
if the SOP is being implemented or not. If not implemented, then the licence of the abattoirs to be revoked.

e LIDI with the Federal Inspection Service (FIS), the State Inspection Service (SIE) and the Municipal Inspection Service (MIS). The inspection
system standardize and ensure quality across the whole country.
Introduce Restricted Substance Lists (RSL) for leather manufacturers
* Risk of restricted chemicals being used and rejection by buyers due to non-compliance
e Failure to conform to global standards, leading to loss of market share and poor reputation as a manufacturing base
RSL plays a critical role in ensuring export products meet chemical compliance programs from the brands and export markets. Responsible chemical management goes beyond complying with test limits or finished materials. Best
practices for chemical management begin with controlling the quality of chemicals sourced and used within a manufacturing facility. By using industry tools that guide procurement of compliant input chemistry, suppliers can
confidently select chemical formulations that enable improved worker safety, in addition to wastewater, material and product compliance that will meet the criteria of export markets and brands. Failure to comply could mean loss
of business, or worse still product recalls which are extremely expensive scenarios.
* LIDI to develop an Ethiopian Restricted Substance List (RSL) in line with LWG base recommendations. The list will be publicly available for tanneries/factories and chemical importers to conform.
e Chemical importers will be required to provide certificate of conformity to ensure that the chemicals are in line with the RSL.
e LIDI to coordinate the RSL testing process in collaboration with a reputable laboratory abroad e. g. SATRA (UK), INTERTEK (Laboratories Worldwide) etc. to ensure that imported chemicals are in line with
the RSL.
e If the chemicals are not in conformation to the RSL, the source will be identified and punitive action will be take (such as  licence revoke of the importer etc. )
LIDI * RSLs have been gaining importance over the last 20 years, and it is commonplace for tanners in other countries, or those suppliers to
large brands to adhere to their RSL guidelines in order to be able to supply to the brands. Taking it further, certain chemical companies
are now offering MRSL chemical inputs, which are pre-screened and thus ensure that they contain no products on the RSL lists, e. g.
Stahl.
Enable existing FDI footwear factories to supply the domestic market with accessories and components
and provide product development services. In the long run, promote new investment in accessories
Delayed delivery time of products due to long lead time needed to secure accessories and components
* Very small scale accessories/components industry in Ethiopia. Currently, there is no business case for new investment due to manufacturing industry not being large enough
The leather product manufacturers, especially the domestic ones, are constrained by timely supply of accessories and components. Also, they suffer from forex shortage which
compounds the complexity. As a result, the factories are not able to meet export orders in time. Alternately, the FDIs have automatically forex available and can import in a timely
fashion. Therefore, there is a potential opportunity for synergy between the FDIs and domestic factories where the FDIs supply accessories to the domestic factories which benefit the

guarantee supply of quality accessories in a timely manner, also ensuring high quality of inputs, which otherwise would be imported from substandard sources and with longer lead times.
e Develop a clear financial transaction mechanism for FDIs to offer this facility.
 Once there is enough volume business for accessories and components i. e. new investment in leather product factories, Ethiopian investment commission should promote and incentivise new FDIs or

Optimise utilisation of existing abattoirs and encouraging modern/commercialized farms and abattoirs
via new investment following the directive already approved by the Ethiopian investment board
* Absence of commercial farms consistently supplying for the meat and also leather industry
* Collection rates vary, revolving around three peak seasons; traders/collectors hoard supply to benefit from high prices in low seasons.
* Poor slaughtering practices leading to poor quality RHS supply.
Leather is a by-product of the meat industry, and predominantly relies on good quality raw material to attain export markets. Currently the farming of the bovine, sheep and goat in the
country is dispersed in turn affecting quality, traceability and consistency in supply.
* Promote new investment in commercial farming and abattoirs. Land should be identified in areas where predominantly there are more animals per Sq KM.
e Opportunities of significantly improving quality are available, not only in the RHS, but also the meat and milk as well, through modern techniques of husbandry, vaccination, favourable grazing
environment (less chance of scratch type defects), better feed, etc apply. Therefore, the investment pitch should consider a comprehensive approach of meat, dairy and leather industry. This approach
poses an opportunity to target investors from the middle-east who are interested in investing in the meat industry.
e This recommendation also poses an opportunity to establish full traceability system, which in turn would attract more export market and brands.
* Introduce better feed supply than can be found naturally, as the structure of the hide/skin is not only genetic but closely associated with dietary.
Benchmark
e Countries such as USA, UK, Brazil have commercial farms that raise herds or flocks of animals primarily for the meat and dairy
industries. They also understand the value of the RHS and work towards reducing ante-mortem defects. As such husbandry practices

conducive storage conditions to avoid post-mortem defects.
Develop pre-tanning process or pickling plant  by abattoirs, traders or tanners
* Storing of RHS is a challenge as the supply is highly seasonal
* Disagreement on grade between the RHS traders and tanner due to transacting at raw stage
* Quality of RHS deteriorate due to challenging transportation system and poor storing
RHS material should be either fully cured or processed as quickly as possible after it is removed from the animal. Typical curing systems involve large amounts of salt (NaCl) which is an issue to the environment and can be difficult
to treat at the effluent stage. An option is to develop a capability for almost immediate processing to occur on the RHS, taking the material through to a processing stage that is safe for the RHS to be held for extended periods of
time without fear of putrefaction. This provides opportunity to be able to genuinely grade the RHS (typically if sold in the raw state it is virtually impossible to detect grain defects, which is a primary driver of the ultimate value
of the RHS). Another aspect to consider is that by creating a pickling plant or metal free pre-tanned leather, it can create opportunity to generate chrome free or metal free leathers, which are gaining traction in the marketplace,
although it is vitally important to understand that within the LWG audit scoring system, if Chrome free leathers are generated from pickle they will obtain a score the same as if it were chrome tanned, whereas a chrome free leather
made without going to the pickle stage will generate a positive scoring. Thus to satisfy the export market (either leather or final products) Ethiopia should not gear up to be effectively only chrome tanned leather, and this system
allows this possibility.
e Develop pickling plant/pre-tanning plant on-site at a the CETP where there are number of abattoirs close by. Alternatively, this could be a joint venture or collaborative approach between local traders and specific tanneries. Process
and new techniques need to be developed within the traders and tanneries to implement the idea. The capacity building initiative could be managed by LIDI and international consultants.
 The pre-tanning process enables traders to store the RHS for longer period, transport safely without the fear of putrefaction and finally allows traders and tanneries to properly grade the RHS. This would enable greater transparency,
consistency and trust amongst the trading stakeholders; leading up-to introduction of contract trading modality which will induce further quality improvement of RHS in the value chain.
e LIDI with Development partners e USA  whilst not exactly the same, they do supply predominantly a wet-blue tanned material for further processing, typically immediately processed
from the abattoir. This allows semi-processed material to be supplied that can be effectively graded and sorted for the resulting final article, and thus
the tanner purchases only what is required. The proposal above is a slight spin on this industry standard.
e New Zealand  has a very large wool sheepskin sector and the skins are typically traded in the pickle stage again as this is a stage where the material
can be safely stored and much more accurate quality grading can be achieved along with size and to a degree of thickness.
Focusing on animal health and handling
* Poor animal health practices leading to deteriorating grade and quality of RHS.
e Poor animal transportation
issues are predominan rand marks, scars, scratches, fighting, or more significantly from parasitic or msect typ g 3 > h") 1s particularly
on skin and hide for causing grain defects similar to cockle witnessed in UK and New Zealand, which can seriously downgrade skin quality. Parasitic (e. g. biting lice, keds, etc) damage far outweighs the other antemortem issues
with suggestions of >65% quality related issues attributed to this, in particular the Ekek defect, and as such there is a significant loss to the tanner, as the parasitic issue is only visualised once at the pickle or wet tanned state. This
ultimately means a loss on three aspects being the initial purchase of the defective skin, secondly the cost of processing such poor quality material and finally the loss of potential profit due to the skin not being fit for the export
type market.
e Extend national animal health programs with support of continuous public fund and permanent staffing and structure. This would enable significant and much needed resource and support to address the animal health issue in a
systemic way.
 Some technical steps can be taken to improve the quality of RHS such as alternatives to branding (e. g. ear tags), selected grazing environments to reduce scratches and scars and research into the best methods of dealing with
the parasites such as regular treatment with topical acaricide treatments {particularly the Diazinon brand), regular shearing (which would also generate some form of by-product) which was proven extremely effective or even
the more natural treatment of phytolacca. Dipping with acaricides, whilst effective, are harder to control, and care must be taken not to allow the animal to ingest the product to avoid poisoning, although with good practices in
place this would be minimised.
 National campaign on treatment of animals in all regions at the same time since the disease is easily transmittable
* MOALR * Developed countries treat animals for all health reasons and realize the opportunity of RHS as a valuable byproduct
Improve access to inputs (chemical and accessories) though strengthening of the current bonded
warehouse system and inducing new investment
e Difficulty of importing chemicals, accessories and components on time. As a result, tanneries and factories are not able to meet the buyers expected time-line and in some
instances production comes to a halt.
Currently the bonded warehouse scenario is not functioning optimally and not reaching the objective it was established for. Weak planning coordination with tanneries, inspection inefficiency and weak awareness by ERCA, higher
transportation and warehouse costs, final price being more expensive than direct import [due to service fees and operational expenses] are some of the reasons contributing to the inefficiency. The major implications are delayed
receipt of chemicals and if a chemical ingredient has to be substituted due to lack of availability then technically it may fail original specifications given. Cascading from this stems the issue of product inconsistency and quality
assurance. Production can essentially come to a halt, not only affecting the output, but also causing untimely delays in completion or orders for export with pre-agreed shipping dates, ultimately resulting in penalties of monetary
value, or forcing to air freight goods which is extremely expensive.
Capacity building of EIDE to improve the bonded warehouse scheme. Consider collaboration with private firms for management and operational support
* MOTV/EIIDE consider working with large chemical companies to bring in chemicals on consignment basis. However, EIIDE must have access to forex and be capitalised to ensure consignment delivery.

* Minimal usage of upgradation technology by tanneries * Lack of speciality chemicals usage/knowledge
* Limited knowledge/capacity of new technology * Lack of modern finishing equipment for upgrading purposes and product diversification
The function of LIDI should essentially be a resource as a centre of excellence. It should be aware of all the latest technologies that are available and build prototype examples of such
technologies on all raw material types. The opportunity here is to act as a genuine resource for the leather industry, where tanners can go not only to see new developments, but be
able to run trials.
e Reform the management structure to function as profit centre, similar to CLRI (Central leather research institute) based in India.
* Introduce profit sharing model from the earnings of LIDI with the employees/researchers who are engaged in developing new products/services.
 Partner with international research institutions and co-invest with private sector/donor to develop new products.
* Develop partnership with international chemical companies research centres and jointly develop products using latest chemicals and Ethiopian raw materials. The idea is to develop/improve the small
scale development centre, which includes wet drums, 600 mm width roller coater (equipped with the necessary varying types of rollers) and small spray line. That way numerous trials can be generated
on a daily basis not only for genuine academic research and development but also creation of export market related leathers.
 Develop practical training and consultancy service products for the leather industry.
* MOTI e CLRI (Central leather research institute) in India, is set up by government but its management model is self-sustaining form products
LIDI and services it offers to the industry. This model incentivizes staff and management to provide pro-active and reliable services to the
industry.
Incentivise R&D and technical laboratory set-up at the tannery and leather product factory premises
e Lack of new product development specific to export market specifications * Absence of continuous process efficiency improvements
 Absence of well organized testing laboratories for quality assurance
The opportunity here is for tanneries and factories to have a private section for leather developments, away from the public setup of LIDL. In addition, it will serve as a centre where
chemical companies can visit and use the facilities to assist in showing new chemical based technologies. Competitive advantage is a key factor in securing and maintaining customers
with interests of new product development in confidentiality. The development centre can also be utilised for scaling up trials (larger quantity salesmen samples) before going in to bulk
production. Furthermore, the laboratory can provide results and feedback on bulk production as well as for R&D. This is critical in that export leathers must be supplied conforming top
pre-agreed technical standards such colour fastness, strength, water resistance, etc. and suppliers should provide batch test results to the customer for QA reassurance.
* R&D and Laboratory Equipment capex purchases should qualify a tax rebate incentive. This will encourage tanneries and factories to invest in setting up lab and hire technical experts.
* MOTI e In the UK, R&D relief allows companies that carry out qualifying R&D related to their trade to claim an extra Corporation Tax
* EIC deduction (230%) for certain qualifying expenditures such as R&D equipment, services, etc. (Guidance: http: //www. hmrc. gov. uk/gds/
cird/attachments/rdsimpleguide. pdf)
Ensure the enforcement of standards such as LWG, ZDHC and RSL certification which are key
compliance requirements globally
e Limited improvement and investment in technology and innovations as per international buyer requirements and standards
Poor production management
LWG is now an internationally recognised standard, and is an independent body made up of chemical suppliers, tanners and brands. The standard was introduced to generate two outcomes; firstly to ensure tanneries were operating
responsibly with regards to the environment and secondly (and often missed by tanneries in developing countries) to create a framework where efficiency of processing can occur and consequently save costs. By becoming certified,
it will give rise to export opportunities and establish the tannery as a world player. RSLs are varied, but do share a common theme. Brands typically impose stringent RSL legislations and as such their products must conform to
ensure that restricted substances are either not used or under certain limits in the final article. Without RSL testing there are barriers to entry to supply many of the leading global brands. ZDHC is a newer initiative that is driving
MRSL's (Material Restricted Substance Lists), but it creates opportunity in that understanding of this initiative means that working with chemical companies who abide by ZDHC will ensure that chemicals sourced from them will
almost certainly conform to brand RSLs.
e It is recommended that existing and new FDI tanneries must attain LWG Bronze or higher. The domestic tanneries would be provided a 5 year window and FDIs would be provided 2 year window. The
ambition is by 2025, all tanneries based in Ethiopia would be LWG certified. This would attract quality leather product factories to base their manufacturing in Ethiopia. As an incentive, the LWG certified
tanneries will be provided with priority for forex allocation.
* LIDI must set-up a department/team to support tanneries in their effort to be LWG certified.
e LIDI should coordinate with donor agencies to support the tanneries for preparatory activities for LWG certification.
e Develop an essential/base Ethiopian Restricted Substance List (RSL) in line with LWG based recommendations.

The opportunity here is to train staff to be fully aware of essential processing control technologies and link these in with LWG protocols where possible. As noted earlier, the LWG is not only to help the
brands, but can significantly improve the efficiency of the tannery in terms of water, energy usage, etc. The aspect here is one of changing mentality, where currently basic inputs of water, energy, etc
are either cheap or free, and thus effectively mistreated and squandered. There needs to be a culture instilled, irrespective of LWG, in that: If you can measure it, then you can control it so that constant
processing improvement review can be generated. The implication is reduced costs in the transformation of the leather and thus a potential competitive advantage in a better selling price and more
consistent product, or if so desired a greater profit margin. Furthermore, control of processing parameters should give far more consistent leather, as required for the export market.
e LIDI to develop training program for tannery technical experts on process control and develop a guideline that would be publicly available. LIDI can collaborate with CLRI and Institute of creative leather
technologies (UK) to develop the training program and guideline.
e LIDI to conduct quarterly audit and provide consultancy service to improve the process control system.
e LIDI e Technical staff from tanneries in Europe, China, Brazil are fully trained in this, and have such systems installed. CLRI and ICLT provide
training and guideline on process control which is established in majority of quality tanneries globally.
Encourage the principle of PPM (Planned Preventative Maintenance) through private service
providers and consultants
* Tanneries/factories operate with multiple machines produced by multiple manufacturers, making planned maintenance services more complex
e Lack of machinery maintenance services within country
* Without PPM, tanneries/factories face significant impact on productivity
It is critical for tanneries and factories to have equipment functioning optimally at all times. If a machine breaks down it can cause a cascade of effects regarding production output and delivery times. As
such PPM is a critical aspect, to ensure that machines are serviced at regular intervals to avoid production capacity issues. In addition by having this service close by on the Modjo cluster, and being able
to service numerous tanneries, the business proposition is attractive for one company to provide this service (albeit that they may call in service technicians from the machine manufacturers if so required).
Furthermore it may remove a further barrier in that they will carry an inventory of spares, thus avoiding forex issues relating to machinery that currently manifest itself. Finally they will be trained in setting
up the machines to operate at optimal efficiency, and provide the necessary skill set in producing consistent and high grade machine operations within the leather transformation process.
e LIDI to have a list of potential institutions and encourage by providing continuous information to the industry actors.
e LIDI  Developed tanneries and factories apply PPM as an essential part of their business
International expert support to ensure that the tanneries and factories are run as per international
business standards
e Not enough capable staff running the factory (procurement, planning and time management, bank processes, logistics arrangement, dealing with ERCA, production
forecasting, communicating with buyers on production/shipment progress etc. )
e Lack of well trained industrial management professionals, costing manager, purchase manager, industrial engineer and top management
Strategic/managerial level expert support can fast-track tannery/factory evolution to export level standards. The expert should be able to provide a plan and time-line of how to improve tanneries/factories
and begin to generate export market sales. In addition they will bring International level thinking and strategy to the business, and be able to train and educate staff not only for the immediate business
climate, but also to understand and adapt to future scenarios that will occur. However, this will come at a significant cost, and there must be enough commitment (both financial and management based)
to support the upgrading of the business in general. This has been tried by bringing in technical experts which could have had much more impact if the experts were to have supported the entire business/
production process as opposed to just technical.
* LIDI to develop a list/pool of international experts that can be hired by tanneries and factories. LIDI's training service (supported by international experts) will develop a pool of local consultant in future.
* Seek support from donor agencies to fund long term deployment of international experts (1/2 years) as opposed to short term assistance.
e Personal income tax exemption for five years for international experts working in the tannery and leather product factories (inline with the incentive offered to the expatriate employees working in industrial
parks).
* China, Vietnam and many other countries hired international experts become such significant actors in the leather value chain in the
world today. It is not feasible to think that local tanneries, whom have had limited experience of dealing internationally can simply
adapt on their own. Domestic evolution takes a long time, but with expert intervention it can fast track the process.

Recommendations focusing on Marketing

digital presence for easy access Reconnaian
Input Suplies Production Process
Build business network through experienced marketers and create a digital presence for easy access
* Limited experience and knowledge in international marketing of finished goods, especially Limited initiatives to strengthen B2B relationship of local producers with international buyers, brands
on how to enter new market spaces and maintain close follow up with business leads. and other actors
* Lack of budget planning and/or limited willingness to allocate marketing funds understanding Limited digital presence
of strategic importance of marketing/promotion.
The Sales and Marketing process has become more complex in modern times, and so it must be completed effectively. Marketing in the leather industry, like many other manufacturing
industries is now more about how to satisfy the customer and their needs. The opportunity of sales agents effectively reduces internal burden of marketing, as they already understand
the needs of the customer and can relay this information accurately and quickly to generate genuine sales possibilities. The overall implication is that sales and marketing has a cost,
possibly higher than what the industry is used to [when it used to sell semi-processed leather]. Now, the game has changed and consequentially a degree of investment has to be made.
e ELIA would identify commission agents in Ethiopia and major exporting destinations. Tanneries and product factories should engage with these commission agents and invest in
marketing activities.
e Digital presence designed with the customer (and consumer) in mind including social media with regular content update in order to prove that the business appreciates and understand
the modern day world.
e Private sector  ELIA e Sales agents are still extremely important in the global competitive environment, not only for their networking aspect and rapid opportunity
potential, but also to avoid conflicts of interest (e. g. some brands are very competitive and so if tanneries/factories supplies Brand A, it effectively
cannot supply to Brand B. Here the sales agent is an effective customer and manage opportunities well.
* Leading tanneries/factories have very slick websites, full of information that customers desire, very professional, and indicate that the company
is one of excellence and extremely well managed. Examples are: www. sadesa. com; www. primeasialeather. com; www. pittards. com; www.

1 Enable domestic tanneries to transact in foreign currency for selling
recommendations
finished leather to the product factories who are exporting
2 Targeting international brands and manufacturers, for increased export and
to induce new investment in Ethiopia
3 Investment promotion via industrial park
Enable domestic tanneries with indirect exports to access USD
e Limited forex availability for tanneries to import inputs such as chemicals
Ethiopia is facing a chronic forex crisis which is affecting the leather industry as it depends on import of chemicals and other foreign inputs, leading to delays within the production
process. For tanneries to continue to supply the leather sector, they need access to forex and in the instances that they transact with FDI product manufacturers, consider allowing a
proportion of that transaction to be in forex.
* Consider to allow USD based transactions for indirect exporters
* Government to allocate a certain percentage of forex for the indirect export value through the national bank to ensure tanneries have access to forex
o MOTI e This scenario was employed in a similar fashion by Taiwan and China many years ago, not only for leather but for many industries including
e FIC garments sector.
 USD based transaction in IPs.
Targeting international brands and manufacturers for increased export and induce new investment in
Ethiopia
e Limited initiatives and interventions in promoting and branding Ethiopia as sourcing and investment hub. Most of the investment promotion is generic and doesnt apply specifically
for leather industry as has been done for garments.
The leather industry is constrained by lack of new foreign investment in the last six years, and it is absolutely crucial to bring quality foreign investment to achieve increased export
performance and employment.
e For the footwear industry, Ethiopia needs to target international brands. The process will kick-start sourcing from some existing factories |crucial to ensure existing manufacturers are supplying the export
market successfully]. This will send a message in the manufacturing industry leading to more manufacturers interested in investment in Ethiopia. The AGOA opportunity is crucial to the manufacturers
which can be optimised. Brands are the leading force in the footwear industry, so it's crucial that Ethiopian leather sector is able to work with anchor brands which will work as domino effect for
increased export and new investment.
e Gloves are classed as accessories, and very few brands operate distinct gloving departments. Instead, brands tend to rely upon the glove manufacturers to bring them possibilities, not only in materials,
but new glove designs and pricing options. Therefore, for gloves, instead to targeting brands, the tactic would be to target top glove manufacturers to invest in Ethiopia.
e LIDI can play a crucial role with EIC to promote new investment based on product development capacity of Ethiopia.
e FIC e China, India and Viet Nam followed such tactic for the last 20 years to generate investment and increased export in their respective countries.
e LIDI Anchor brands and international experts worked closely with relevant ministry and investment agencies to promote products and incentives to
manufacturers.
Investment promotion via Industrial Parks
e Limited new investment in Ethiopia in leather goods manufacturing
From the currently operational [Ps Adama, Bole Lemi [ & II, Kombolcha, Mekele, Aysha (Diredawa) are capable of hosting leather goods manufacturers. In addition, George Shoe and
Huajian are constructing [Ps that are dedicated for leather goods manufacturing.
e The Ethiopian Investment Commission should design and implement a focused investment promotion in selected countries to attract leather manufacturing FDIs
* The focus shall be on key manufacturers who are leading across selected categories of products
The investment promotion shall also target key value chain actors for the leather goods manufacturing such as chemical manufacturers and suppliers, leather product accessory manufacturers and
packaging material producers ensuring added cost competitiveness and meeting lead time and quality requirements of the international market
* BIC
e Italy, Turkey and India have used Industry Parks and special economic zones to promote FDI and local investment aggressively. The IPs and zones
are integrated along the value chain with key suppliers of components, chemicals, machinery and other inputs having service centres in place.

construction recommendations
Increased and systematic checks of tanneries for installing primary and secondary treatment plant. This
is to be accelerated via GoE investment in construction.
* Non-compliance with EPA and buyers requirement on waste water treatment
e Heavy pollution and poor sector image for Ethiopia internationally
There is no reason why effluent discharges originating from Ethiopian tanneries should be failing EPA standards. The standards have been in place a long time, LIDI has been completing effluent testing, and yet still the tanneries
did not seem to fully comply. This resulted in a Government crackdown recently, forcing Primary and secondary ETP's to be installed. But the progress is slow. In addition the tanneries could have gone some way to basic process
efficiency steps in order to drop the effluent discharge loadings. The implication is that the tanneries are polluting the environment, and not conforming to EPA standards based upon the latest figures supplied. Ethiopia cannot
afford an environmental disaster, either in tangible terms of pollution in the country nor bad media possibilities. Furthermore, it is not wise that FDIs are allowed to enter the Ethiopian leather industry and not have ETPs installed
from the onset of the tannery building phase. FDI's should automatically realise that they need to operate with ETPs and how damaging poor effluent can be to the environment, and as such are simply abusing the situation and
opportunity in the country.
All tanneries not involved with a CETP, need to have fully operational effluent treatment facilities (both primary and secondary) that comply with Ethiopian EPA values as a minimum, and produce a regular official reporting
mechanism to ensure compliance. Failure to comply will mean licences are revoked until proof of compliance.
* Any new investors (domestic or FDI) will need to prove compliance within three months of commissioning the tannery.
 Random checks by EPA to occur. Within 12 months time-line, 70% of the tanneries should come under random checks. Such intensive checks should continue next few years to ensure greater compliance by the tanneries.
e GoE would set-up a fund to invest via grants (by donors) or zero %interest loans for funding on a cost-share basis of the initial capital required to construct the treatment plants
o MOTI China, Italy, India, Vietnam all have very strict rule on implementation of EPA rulings.
e [PA * India has a policy to invest in 65% of the required finance for construction to be environmentally compliant. Federal government invests 30% and
regional government invests 35%.
Put in place a standard guide for responsible water usage
* Miss use of water. Water is treated as natural resource which is abundance in supply.
* Absence of flow meters to measure water input and discharge.
Water is treated as a free resource as it mainly comes from boreholes. There is a poor attitude to the use of water and understanding its value, simply through not even bothering to
measure how much is used. Such a stance is not tolerated by many of the brands, and thus again it will become an environmental based barrier to entry/trade with many of the export
markets.
e The use of water must be considered, through introduction of tamper-proof water flow meters, so that the amount of water coming in to the tannery can be recorded and referenced
against the volume of leather produced. The target set will be according to the LWG audit protocol.
e [t will be mandatory for all the tanneries to install the water flow meters and tracking of water usage. The data will be regularly recorded and shared with LIDI to ensure the target is met.
e LIDI - playing support role * Global tanneries recognize water consumption recording as a central activity.
 EPA  playing regulatory role
Finalize the Modjo Common Effluent Treatment Plan (CETP) plant construction.
* Non-compliance with EPA and buyers on waste water treatment requirement
Poor functioning effluent plant at firm level and huge investment cost to install a
fully operational effluent treatment plant
* Heavy pollution and poor sector image for Ethiopia internationally
C Is absolutely crucial to the development ot the industry and minimise the cost of
production for tanneries, while comply to global standard. 1s a sensible way to address effluent treatment tor large scale manutacture
of leather within a cluster, so long as it is built correctly and to an extremely high standard; in truth it should be used as a valuable marketing tool for the Ethiopian leather industry. It will bring about reassurance that ALL effluent is
treated correctly and discharged to specified standards, which would be a massive benefit to the country, considering that the tanneries with currently operating ETP's do not seem to even be able to comply with EPA standards. The
CETPs would likely charge using a cost matrix based upon the amount of water discharged and the various effluent loading categories (e. g. chromium, NaCl, BOD, COD, etc), and this way the tanneries cannot cheat (i. e. they could
reduce Cr levels in their feed to the CETP by diluting with twice as much water). Consequently tamper-proof water meters would be installed to record this. This would in turn drive the tanneries to review their processing efficiencies,
and realise that they must use less water throughout the transformation process. This in turn would drive a better stance on the utilisation of water being such a valuable resource. Other benefits are likely to be that CETP's effluent
treatment would be significantly cheaper than if the tannery were completing it by themselves, and as such drive greater price competitive advantage to their sales.
o CETP of very high standards must be constructed in the Modjo proposed cluster. The contractor for this must not simply be awarded on price, but through proof of successful implementation in other countries and validated by a
number of experts.
* LWG certified auditor should be part of the advisory board, to ensure the right contractor is selected of global standard and is supervised during the construction process.
 The CETP, being a stand-alone enterprise would need to also look at continuous improvement and various technologies that could upgrade the system over time as the handling of wastewater and treatment systems is constantly
evolving.
e [PDC e China, Italy, India have clusters of tanneries with CETP.
e MOTI * Bangladesh used a contractor selected based on cost and as such the facility is not up-to global standards, and has generated even further bad press
for their sector.
Recommendations focusing on Incentives, Coordination, Logistics, and Customs
Custom and Logistic Incentives and Coordination
Performance-based incentives need to be introduced and structured
around the need of the sector
Create a joint taskforce between key supporting institutions to serve as Policy
a central coordinating body to drive necessary change recommendations
WN =
Set logistic competitiveness target and establish custom window
dedicated to leather
Introduce performance based new incentives for value addition and improve management of existing
incentive mechanisms
* Absence of export performance based incentives
* Manufacturers unable to gain full benefits from voucher system incentives
* Material list (consumption per product and material naming) in the input- output coefficient is not regularly updated (does not reflect regular changes in finished products landscape)
As part of the incentive mechanism the GoE has put out includes the voucher system by which manufacturers get duty drawback for the inputs they have imported and used for export.
However, the system including the input-output coefficient is not easy to work with nor is it regularly updated to reflect the latest input requirement of the global market. This is causing
manufacturers not to take full advantage of voucher system incentives and also to pay unexpected tax penalties. Additional overhead costs are incurred in dealing with different
government bodies. Responsible government bodies also suffer from constant change of dedicated/assigned department/experts leading to loss in knowledge of processes ultimately
leading to delays in processing and making decisions.
* Introduce bold/well studied incentives to promote export and indirect export performance
* Automate input-output system for ease of use by all industry actors
* Continuous capacity building and alignment/coordination between all the relevant members (LIDI, MOI, ERCA, ELIA)-more weight to ERCA which is customer facing body with
regulatory capacity
e LIDI/MOI * India promoted export by providing up to 19% direct export cash rebate in the 1980/90s Indias leather sector 25-30 years ago is where Ethiopia's
e FIC current sector performance]
* India employs an efficient and automated input-output coefficient management system
Create a joint taskforce between key supporting institutions to serve as a central coordinating body to
drive necessary change
e Lack of coordination amongst different implementing agencies leading to weak performance tracking interventions to support the industry.
East Asian economies who are leader in the manufacturing industry, all had a central coordinating agency or ministry that served as a combination of think-tank, policy maker and
coordination mechanism for the line ministries involved. Taking learnings from global experiences, it may be beneficial to establish an empowered joint task-force to drive necessary
change across organizations.
e Establish a joint taskforce (Mol, EIC, LIDI, ERCA, NBE and IPDC), which should serve as a central coordinating body; empowered to drive the necessary changes across the board.
Each associated agency would have a responsible dedicated individual to participate in the coordination meetings (arranged to meet quarterly) and manage needs emerging from the
leather sector.
e The taskforce should have a high quality monitoring and evaluation framework and resources to ensure the performance of the decisions are tracked and implemented.
 Committee composed of MoTl, EIC, LIDI Japan: The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MIT) played a key role in developing and implementing industrial policy especially during the period of reconstruction and growth
!  ! from 1950 to the 1970s. MITI regularly monitored the needs of the industry and coordinated closely with the companies and sub-sectors that it was supporting. Deliberation councils,
ERCA, NBE and IPDC committees and study groups, sometimes with the big industrial associations, were all used to ensure that policy reflected the ever changing reality of industry, and industrial strategies were
revised every one or two years to ensure their pertinence.
* MITI, in addition to strategy and coordination, worked on issues that were beyond the scope of companies (individually or collectively) such as R&D, infrastructure, trade negotiations and
overall business environment.
* China: Alter Deng Xiaoping launched the opening-up strategy in the late 1970s, a State Council Office was established for Special Economic Zones (SEZ) to conceptualize and implement
the SEZs.
 [n 2003, the State Council Office for Restructuring the Economic System and the State Economic and Trade Commission were merged to form the National Development and Reform
Commission (NDRC), a super-Ministry with 26 functional departments; develops five year plans, investment strategies, industrial policies and economic restructuring programs.
* Singapore: The Singapore Economic Development Board (EDB) was also established in 1961 to attract investment and create jobs. It became the lead government agency for planning and
executing strategies to ensure Singapores position in the global economy. The EDB envisions, plans and delivers medium term strategies that position Singapore as a venue for investment,
originally in labour intensive manufacturing and later in capital intensive and high-tech industries
Set logistic competitiveness target
* Weak logistic and custom services leading to delay in importing inputs and export of products.
Import lead times are long and expensive compared to benchmark countries; lead times are affected by both customs clearance and logistics transportation. Customs clearance is slow, and lacks efficiency
and standards; 77% of the time required to trade across borders is needed for document preparation and customs clearance and inspections. Documentation and clearance can also add over US $1,000 to
the cost of the trade procedure, for example 10% of all goods shipped in one instance were delayed directly as a result from inefficient customs handling. A national logistics strategy has been developed
and is expected to bring positive changes when fully implemented.
* Set logistics competitiveness targets around cost and lead time, and develop a roadmap to achieve targets for the leather sector
e Ethiopian Shipping & Logistics Services
Enterprise (ESLSE)
* China; the national logistics strategy is the responsibility of the Ministry of Transport, restructured in 2008. In addition to planning policies and standards, the Ministry also supervises the
implementation of plans. To support the implementation process, a national inter-ministry conference on logistics brings 15 relevant agencies together once or twice per year.
Indonesia; national Logistics Blueprint sets out the roadmap for the development of the industry by government, local and provincial authorities and the private sector over the period 2011-
2015. The national logistics strategy was formulated through the cooperation of a range of experts and practitioners, including relevant ministries and government agencies, private sector
(through associations), international institutions and academics.
* Malaysia; national logistics plan is incorporated into the Third Industrial Plan for 2006-2020, coordinated by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, which includes logistics as a
priority industry. Preceded by an in-depth analysis of the current state of the logistics industry, the plan then sets out clear targets based on the expected increase in total merchandise trade
* Korea; Republic of Korea has been developing comprehensive logistics plans and regulations since the 1990s. Prior to this, logistics plans focused on one transport mode at a time. Since the
2000s, logistics policies have focused on developing logistics as an industry, rather than a supporting function of manufacturing, and developing the Republic of Korea as a logistics hub. As
a concrete sign of this, the Goods Distribution Promotion Act enacted in 1991 was replaced by a comprehensive Framework Act on Logistics Policies in 2007. A 10-year National Logistics
Master Plan is developed based on the guidelines set by the Act.

Establish a human resource development fund to support with worker training in both soft and hard
skills
e Ethiopia faces a structural challenge to industrialization due to difficulty of sourcing skilled workers
Low rates of labour efficiency varies from factory to the next, one international factory indicates reaching efficiency levels similar to Bangladesh (47-48%) while others experience rates as low as 25%. Low efficiency is due to
low technical (machine mechanic and electrical/electronic) skill level and unfamiliarity with factory work. It limits progression to higher quality and higher fashion products and consequently the range manufacturers can provide
buyers. Another major issue is, absenteeism from work resulting from poor attitudes towards work, and lack of industrial orientation)
e Create a human resource development fund to support factories with training. Employers would pay a levy of 1% of their workers payroll towards a skills fund to support training in hard & soft skills. Funding is given to pre-
approved public or private training service providers who apply for funding. The grants are self sustaining because they boost employment and hence the volume of the payroll levy. The fund should have a high autonomy, with
employers having majority seats on the Board to ensure the fund matches industry needs, and does not become too bureaucratic.
LIDI and MoLSA should co-ordinately work to develop and manage the fund.
e LIDI and MoLSA  Malaysia  The Human Resources Development Fund (HRDF) is an organization under the Human Resources Ministry of Malaysia with a mandate to catalyze the
development of competent local workforce. A payroll levy of one percent for employers with > 50 employees (or, 0.5 percent for small enterprises that wish to
participate) is used for partial reimbursement of approved training expenses. Those who have contributed a minimum of six months are then eligible to claim a portion
of allowable training expenses up to the limit of their levy payments for the year. In addition, the HRDF provides firms with grants for developing training plans.
e Singapore  The Skills Development Fund (SDF) support is used to support workforce upgrading programmes and to provide training grants to employers when they
send their employees to attend training. Under this system, an employer tax on low-skilled labor finances government grants for training, including at government-
provided training centers. The effect has been to penalize companies for long term use of unskilled labor and incentivize employer commitments to training. The
fund is run by the Singapore Workforce Development Agency (WDA). The WDA provides financial incentives to companies that send their employees on training
programmes that include Basic Education for Skills Training (BEST), Modular Skills Training (MOST), Worker Improvement through Secondary Education (WISE), Core
Skills for Effectiveness and Change (COSEC), and Critical Enabling Skills Training (CREST).
Workers health and safety procedures and guidelines development and enforcement
* Absence of safe and quality workplace leading to failing buyers audit
* Absence of standard procedures and accountability leading to lack of safe work-place initiatives by factories
As per PROCLAMATION NO. 4/1995  Powers and Duties of MOLSA 1) Determine standards and measures for the safety and health of workers and follow up their implementation;
2) Collect, compile and disseminate information on safety and health of workers. However, the specific H&S standards and administrative procedures need development and requires
enforcement. Global brands are also quite stringent about social compliance and Ethiopia must prepare itself to export to high end clients.
* Detailed procedures and guidelines developed, supported by ILO.
* Two years implementation period would be provided to tanneries/factories to comply to the standard.
* MoLSA will conduct periodic audit of the factories to ensure if the factories are implementing the procedures. [f not, a fine will be introduced.
* MoLSA and LIDI cooperation * All exporting factories are required to put in place workers health and safety procedures
Set-up worker service support centres to improve retention and address worker unrest related
issues
e Lack of worker support services especially for women workers leading to low level of retention.
* Poor communication and relationship between factory managers and operators leading to labour unrest, affecting production.
There are high turnover in factories, partly due to low wages, difficulty adjusting to factory life, and communication barriers between workers and managers. Turnover ranges from 10% to as high as 70% in a year for various
factories. High turnover further exacerbates the challenge of low efficiency, as a result, any investment in skills development are not fully realized. Therefore, the factories are not investing in skills development which is creating
a vicious cycle.
e Establish workers support service centres near George shoe IP, Huajian IP and Modjo city to support workers with adjusting to industrial life. Specific services that would be provided to help workers make the transition to industrial
life include counselling and mediation between workers and managers.
e Given that about 70% of the workforce in the sector are women, companies can build loyalty/retention by providing services that are likely to increase retention of female employees e. g. child care, reproductive health education
etc.
 The worker support centers should also provide training for mid-level managers to understand workforce motivations, conflict resolution and communication to improve labour management relations and reduce the gap between
local and expatriate staff.
e Such initiatives could be managed by MoLSA and the funding could be a PPP initiative as the factories have direct incentive to invest in such services.
 MoLSA Global buyers including H&M, GAP, Levi Strauss, and Adidas partner with ILO Better Work programme to provide a Workplace Cooperation Program for its factories,
e LID/MOTI that gives workers and managers the skills they need to resolve workplace issues. Brands pay for factory audits and related activities.
. FIC Brandix, the largest exporter of apparel in Sri Lanka, has established an employee focused culture and CSR initiatives in their worker communities to build loyalty.
They provide free transportation, onsite health clinics, and discounted grocery shopping. As 85% of employees are women, it provides child care, pregnancy care,
and flexible-work arrangements.
