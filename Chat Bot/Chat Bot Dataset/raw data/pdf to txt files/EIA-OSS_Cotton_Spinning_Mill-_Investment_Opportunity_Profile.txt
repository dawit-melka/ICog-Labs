Cotton Spinning Opportunity
Executive Summary
Market e Domestically, the demand for cotton yarn is outstripping supply, having grown
Opportunity by 23% over the last four years in comparison to 21% growth in supply
e Ethiopia has the competitive advantage to produce yarn at low cost and
service this market but currently lacks the capacity to do so
e Globally, the demand for Ethiopian cotton yarn has been increasing by 11%
per year as a result of increased quality of yarn production in Ethiopia
e The investment opportunity is in a green-field cotton spinning mill in Ethiopia
e The cotton spinning plant will source its raw materials locally and serve both
local and export markets
e New, world class equipment will be used to ensure top quality yarn produced
e The opportunity requires a capital investment of USD 44.6m and is expected
to generate an internal rate of return (IRR) of 19% over 5 years
e The project is expected to create 260 job opportunities in Ethiopia
Enabling

Key strategies, policies and incentives implemented by GoE such as tax
holidays create a favorable operating environment
 In addition, various enablers are being initiated by public stakeholders and
donors along the cotton and textile value chain, these include cheaper bank
loans and match-making between Ethiopian cotton yarn and textile producers
and buyers from the United State of America (USA) and Europe

e Domestic demand for cotton yarn has been driven by the
growth in the textile and garment industry
 Ethiopia was one of the fastest growing apparel
exporters between 2005  2011
eo The GoE has placed a large emphasis on growing
the textiles industry from a USD 21.8mto a USD 1bn
industry by 2015 according to the Growth and
Transformation Plan (GTP)
e Local demand is expected to continue to grow driven by
an increase in quality of yarn produced and
disposable incomes
 GDP per capita has grown on average by 9.9% per
annum
Cotton yarn production has grown at a CAGR of 21%
over the last four years
Whilst this growth has been significant, Ethiopia will
struggle to maintain this level of growth or match
local demand
 Ethiopian spinning mills can currently produce a
maximum of ~87 100 tons
 However the average capacity of the plants is only
around 60% (~52 260 tons) due to old machinery,
poor management and lack of trained labor
ability
 This is likely to cause a supply gap which will tend to
increase unless more yarn can be produced

Investment Highlights

Operational Highlights
The proposed spinning plant will purchase cotton lint from ginneries and sell the processed
yarn both locally through wholesalers and internationally through marketers
e Cotton lint is the main raw material needed for the production of yarn and will be
sourced from local ginneries and traders
o Other raw materials, such as paper cones, plastic bobbins and caps, cans and
plastic bags are readily available locally
e The plant will use new, state of the art spinning machinery including renowned
brand names such as Marzoli, Rieter, Trutzchler and Lakshmi
 In the first year the plant is estimated to produce 6 400 tons, before producing at a
full capacity of 8 000 tons in subsequent years
 Full capacity will be based on planned production over 320 days a year!
e The production plant will be able to produce three types of cotton yarn:
 Combed yarn
 Carded yarn
 Open-end yarn
e Cotton yarn produced will be sold primarily to the local market
 80% will be distributed domestically to textile mills who typically export their
finished goods and therefore require high quality cotton yarn
 20% of yarn produced will be exported to supply the higher quality grade yarn
the mill produces to more stringent but potentially more profitable export markets

Spinning Operation Value Cha
The spinning plant will source quality raw materials locally and process the cotton lint
efficiently into high quality cotton yarn to be sold in the market
e Cotton lint will be purchased directly from
ginneries and in some instances through traders
should a particular ginnery have low stock

 e The traders will deliver the lint to the spinning
mill, where a quality check will be done to
ensure only best inputs are processed
e The spinning plant will capitalize on world class
machinery to ensure production efficiency

MILL majority will be Ethiopians

Social Benefits
Apart from economic benefits, the investment will have a positive impact on Ethiopia's social
development
Employment Opportunity
e The spinning plant will employ
approximately 260 people
Technology and Skills Transfer
o New technology will increase the quality of
cotton yarn produced for export from
o Staff will be trained and will develop new
and additional skills for the Ethiopian
textiles sector
Support Local Cotton Farmers
o All raw materials will be locally sourced
o Cotton farmers will benefit from the
increased demand of ~26 650 tons of raw
cotton?

supply
Bureaucracy / lack of coordination: Enlist the support of EIA with regard to any
Operationalization can be delayed due to operationalization bottlenecks
bottlenecks in processes such as land Locate the plant in an IDZ as the process for
Regulatory allocation land allocation in one involves less red tape
Risks Import of raw materials: It could be Obtain supporting letter from EIA to facilitate
