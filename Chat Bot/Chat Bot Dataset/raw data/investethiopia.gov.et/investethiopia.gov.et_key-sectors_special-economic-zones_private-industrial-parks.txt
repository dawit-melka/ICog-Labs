INVEST IN ETHIOPIA / PRIVATE INDUSTRIAL PARKS
Private Industrial ParksDriving industrialization through integration―a manufacturing model at its best 
Contact UsPaving the way for investorsThe investment potential we offer in the development of industrial parks have been the catalyst for an increasing number of investors engaging in this type of investment. Till now, six privately developed industrial parks have started rendering services to over 200 companies. The import-substitution potential is huge in Ethiopia—a factor that is influencing growth of the manufacturing sector and increasing demand for factory spaces. We encourage investors to explore the opportunities to engage in this lucrative industrial parks development opportunity and become leaders in our industrial revolution.
