INVEST IN ETHIOPIAPRIVATE SEZsDriving industrialization through integration―a manufacturing model at its best The investment potential we offer in the development of SEZs has been the catalyst for an increasing number of investors engaging in this type of investment. Recently, six privately developed SEZs began rendering services to over 200 companies. The import-substitution potential is huge in Ethiopia—a factor that is influencing growth of the manufacturing sector and increasing demand for factory spaces. We encourage investors to explore the opportunities to engage in this lucrative SEZ development opportunity and become leaders in our industrial revolution.
