The Ethiopian market offers various attractive opportunities in the Agriculture space.Investors can choose a single or multiple, end-to-end investment opportunities.
CropsEthiopia offers a strong potential for production of cereals including wheat, rice, maize, and sorghum. The estimated market value of cereals in Ethiopia is over $4.1 billion, and there is huge potential for export. Over 476,821 hectares of land suitable for cultivation of crops has been allocated by different regions and are awaiting investors’ engagement. 
LivestockEthiopia presents an immense potential for livestock rearing and processing of dairy and meat products. Per capita consumption of milk is 19 liters/year, one of the lowest in sub-Saharan, indicating the potential to engage in improving productivity of cattle and increase supply. Demand for red meat is increasing by 7% annually, and due to organicity, Ethiopian meat is highly demand in the international market.
PoultryEthiopia has one of the largest chicken populations in Africa but is lagging in per capita consumption of eggs and chicken meat—often consuming two to 10-times lower than African peer countries. However, the average low consumption trend in the country is an indication of the considerable potential that the Ethiopian market holds. Urbanization, increasing income and the emerging nutrition-conscious low middle-class communities in Ethiopia are significantly increasing demand for poultry products. 
Animal FeedDemand for animal feed in Ethiopia is growing rapidly and the demand-supply gap in the country is estimated to be over 160,000 tons annually, valued at over $200 million. In addition, Ethiopia is strategically located to effectively compete in the $2.9 billion animal feed market in East and North Africa, which is dominated by imports from Europe. Our proximity to these markets allows investors to become a low-cost supplier in the global market.

In addition, Ethiopia presents a suitable climate conditions and massive land for cultivating a variety of fruits and vegetables including banana, avocado, mango, potatoes and tomatoes. Due to increasing consumption and the growing industrialization, local demand is also growing by 30% annually, which provides investors the opportunity to become a leading supplier of organic produce. 
PulsesThe local market for production and distribution of pulses is estimated to be over $831 million and is growing by 5% annually. There is 94,503 hectares of land suitable for production of pulses including faba beans, field peas, chick-peas, grass peas and soya. 
CottonThere is 562,757 ha of land suitable for cotton production in Ethiopia.

Increasing agricultural outputs is the key to meeting growing demand for food and inputs for industries. In addition, as the sector promises potential foreign currency earnings, it is considered a priority sector for development. The government has been investing in infrastructure, institutional reforms, inclusive markets, and innovation and extension services while creating an enabling environment for private sector investment.
