develop policy recommendations to address the constraints Context of the study While existing sector development initiatives have resulted in an emerging dynamic and export oriented textiles and apparel industry in Ethiopia the sector continues to face key challenges and as a result has not yet met expectations The Ethiopian Investment Commission and the Ministry of Trade and Industry commissioned this study to build on the existing studies and develop policy recommendations to unleash growth Objectives of the study The primary objective of this study was to assess synthesize and identify key bottlenecks faced by the Ethiopian Textile and Apparel Value Chain and to develop and socialize policy recommendations to catalyze the sector ie whats needed More specifically there are six objectives for this study 1 Provide overview of the global textile and apparel value chain eco system 2 Assessment of the Ethiopian Textile and Apparel and identification of key bottlenecks 3 Develop detailed policy recommendations to address key bottlenecks in the sector modeled after the template used for pharmaceutical sector policy recommendations 4 Employ a highly consultation approach conducting field missions with key stakeholders on both the demand supply and side to test hypothesized policy recommendations 5 Construct goals and targets for improved competitiveness comparing ethiopian current performance to benchmark countries and setting future goals 6 Develop an implementation plan or plans for the policy recommendations identified over a five year period

reports consulted is included in Annex 10 Various bottlenecks were identified across the TA ve and categorized into 6 binding issue constraints and three thematic area constraints 12 Issue Area Main Challenges Inefficient customs processing 17 days import time for Ethiopia 5 days for Sri lana leads to long lead times A lack of standards which results in high variability in the timelines for clearing imported goods 10 of all goods shipped in one case study were delayed directly as a result of inefficient customs handling High inland transportation costs importing to Ethiopia is more than 5 times the cost of importing to inland transportation costs for imports are about us 5470 for Ethiopia compared to us 1380 for Banking Access to fix iN Shortage of foreign currency low fore liquidity delays importation and expansion plans For exporters this shortage is driven by inability to if retain export earnings manufacturers can only retain 30 of earned fore the remaining 70 is converted to local currency after 28 days 1 Low liquidity in the banking sector adds to challenges of high perceived risk in TA causing high interest rates 9 115 from state banks Workforce debt and up to 18 from private banks and long approval times for loans up to 6 months Difficulty sourcing workers due to largely agrarian background coupled by low efficiency and productivity efficiency levels are as low as 25 compared to 4647 High turnover driven by low wages and lack of worker facilities in IPs eg housing and transport Some firms report turnover rates of 10 Customs others as high as 70 and Logistics oN IP Development A lack of coordination across agencies in the development of plans for parks and local economic development causing poor integration with loyalties Little tailored support incentives to meet needs of firms that surpass the typical domestic firm A lack of guidelines to promote or measure degree of effective knowledge transfer A lack of incentives or controls in place to regulate the subcontract market Low quality and high cost of local products are the underlying reasons for importation of inputs across the supply chain Eg poor quality of cotton causes losses of our 144000 per 100 tons of cotton Limited technological capacity high cost of equip and low financial capability to expand for textiles firms and wineries Source stakeholders Interviews to Textile and Clothing value Chain Roadmap 2016 Various bottlenecks were identified across the TA ve and categorized into 6 binding issue constraints and three thematic area constraints 22 Issue Area Incentives Main Challenges Inability of the current set of incentives to address fundamental operational challenges eg access to fore Inability to measure the effects of the current set of incentives because they are not A lack of tailoring to the specific type of stakeholders Recommendations Increase supplier credit limit to give TA exporters more room for conducting routine international transactions Allow companies within IPs to trade foreign currencies between themselves in a swap system Extend fore transactions to input providers outside IPs Leverage dedicated financing facilities and increased supplier credit to facilitate greater access to trade finance for domestic and international firms Issue Area Promotion A lack of and aggressiveness to pursue consistent relationships with international investors which is slowing down the achievement of growth targets exports in 2016 were us him 33 of the us target A delay in achieving quality and capability standards that can set Ethiopia apart from competitors Strengthen linkages to meet the specific needs of the TA sector Institute a human resource management body to manage worker recruitment across the industry Establish a human resource development fund to support worker training Set up worker service support centers to improve retention Consider setting up a minimum wage for the sector Issue Area Institutional Arrangements No specific mandate to promote the sectors growth among most government agencies Limited ability to enforce change across institutions due to conflicting priorities Limited use of data for effective Define a specific mandate for promoting the sectors growth among government agencies Strengthen coordination mechanisms to enforce change across institutions Enhance the use of data for effective Source stakeholders Interviews to Textile and Clothing Value Chain Roadmap 2016 To address the identified bottlenecks within the issue area specific recommendations were designed Issue Area Description of Recommendations Increase the supplier credit limit to provide more room for routine international transactions Allow companies within IPs to trade foreign currencies in a swap system Leverage dedicated financing facilities and increased supplier credit for greater access to trade finance Institute a human resource management body to manage worker recruitment Workforce Development Develop national logistics targets for improved competitiveness Allocate dedicated customs officers with knowledge of the TA sector at each service point with 247 availability in IPs Implement clear standards and procedures to facilitate customs clearing Incentivize firms to develop container parks Develop and green parks to support investment promotion in building a brand known for compliance Develop a blueprint to guide integrated planning of future industrial parks Support for Domestic Manufacturers Provide extended financial and technical support for domestic manufacturers who show potential to be star performers Promote knowledge transfer from expatriates to local employees by instituting guidelines around expat hire Develop regulations and approval processes to guide and control subcontracting practices Capacity Building in Auxiliary Input Industry Initially focus on improving the capacity and quality of the local auxiliary input industry Joint Ventures and Cotton Sector Strengthening Promote joint ventures in winning and textiles to address the equipment financing and skills gaps that reduce productivity Strengthen the local cotton sectors incorporation into the export supply chain as a medium to longterm strategy Thematic Area Recommendations Incentives Structure a set of incentives around specific national priorities Structure incentives to address operational challenges faced by investors Tailor incentives to address the unique challenges of different types of actors across the supply chain Promotion Employ a staged approach prioritizing the development of basic products in the short term and moving to higher fashion apparel in the long term Target both US and European buyers who are large enough to attract manufacturers Increase the use of overseas government representation and affiliations to increase visibility to buyers Institutional Arrangements Create a joint task force between key supporting institutions Optimize collection and use of data at tide

Overview What is the concept of a Global Value Chain and Global Production network Global Production Network Global Commodity Chain Elements of a Commodity Chain As trade in intermediate goods the import content of exports grew in importance scholars adopted the Global Value Chain concept placing more emphasis on the generation and capture of value in the different stages of production The Global Production Network concept then extended this approach by adding the full complex of intro inter and networks to the analysis This includes the institutional context and regulatory mechanisms as well The global value chain and global production networks concepts are used interchangeable and we will follow that convention in this study In the scholars coined Global Commodity Chains with two components 1 value chain typical of industries such as aircraft or automobiles where the producer maintains control over production Capital and Require highway skilled labor Rely on a network of suppliers for supply of components 2 value chains common in apparel and footwear Do not involve investment of capital or technology by the buyer Rely on loose networks of outsourced or contracted suppliers to provide finished goods using labor Global value chains involve a series of steps or stages from raw materials to retail to consumption and recycling At each level an ecosystem of actors comes together to complete the product and transfer it to the next level The ecosystem involves natural and human capital goods and service providers regulators and financial institutions The value chain is characterized by asymmetric of power weak governance and positive and negative In order to ensure that the value chain serves ethiopian economic social and environmental objectives a comprehensive and holistic strategy is necessary The key components to achieve competitive value chains in Ethiopia focus on 1 Completing joining and enhancing each link in the chain to create a healthy ecosystem 2 Ensuring backward linkages and cluster development 3 Creating opportunities for local sees 4 Securing technology and skill transfer 5 Raising the competitiveness of the Ethiopian export sector as a whole through the diffusion of learning The concept of a Global Value Chain get and Global Production Network gun As trade in intermediate goods the import content of exports gained importance scholars adopted the Global Value Chain concept emphasizing the generation and capture of value in different stages of production The Global Production Network concept extended this approach incorporating intro inter and networks along with institutional and regulatory contents The terms global value chain and global production networks are used interchangeable In the scholars introduced Global Commodity Chains with two components 1 value chain Typical in industries like aircraft or automobiles where the producer maintains control over production Capital and Requires highway skilled labor Relies on a network of suppliers for supply of components 2 value chains Common in apparel and footwear Does not involve investment of capital or technology by the buyer Relies on loose networks of outsourced or contracted suppliers to provide finished goods using labor For the Textile and Apparel value chain in Ethiopia a holistic approach is crucial It should be viewed as a whole integral interdependent system requiring proper functioning of all its component parts for competitive value chains Emphasis should be on completing joining and enhancing each link in the chain to create a healthy ecosystem Key considerations for ethiopian value chains include Ensuring backward linkages and cluster development Creating opportunities for local sees Securing technology and skill transfer Global value chains involve a series of steps from raw materials to retail consumption and recycling The ecosystem comprises natural and human capital goods and service providers regulators and financial institutions The value chain is characterized by power asymmetric weak governance and positive and negative To ensure the value chain serves ethiopian economic social and environmental objectives a comprehensive and holistic strategy is necessary This includes raising the competitiveness of the Ethiopian export sector through the diffusion of learning Commodity Chain Fashion Industry The fashion industry stands out as one of the largest and most sectors globally In 2016 its estimated total value reached a staggering 24 trillion surpassing other major industries such as media transportation and even commercial and professional services If we conceptualize the fashion industry as a country its market size in 2016 would rank as the economy globally exceeding the economies of India and Italy Despite its significant economic impact some still perceive the fashion industry as frivolous and indulgent Additionally information about the industry is often fragmented incomplete or unreliable with systematic reporting lacking across market segments product categories operating models and regions Source The State of Fashion 2017 mckinley and The global apparel export market was valued at us 443 billion in 2016 employing an estimated 25 million people worldwide Key points In 2015 the World Trade Organization to valued the global apparel export market at 445 billion marking a twofold increase from the value in 2000 However the growth rate of the worlds apparel trade slowed down in 201516 Factors contributing to this slowdown include increasing consumer preference for discounts and the industry low adaptability to changing consumer behavior and preferences In 2014 the industry employed about 25 million people globally nearly double the figure in 2000 The apparel industry offers strong potential for high employment particularly for relatively individuals presenting opportunities especially for women Source 1 shingle Fashion World Trade Statistical Review 2019 2 Fashion United Global trends are favorable to ethiopian ambitions as apparel companies are increasingly looking to source from East Africa Recent Attractiveness of Trends the East African Market Recent trends point to a repositioning of global garment sourcing Asia is the traditional powerhouse of textiles and garment manufacturing and will likely remain so in the near future China and alone accounted for us 267 billion and us 309 billion of global textile and garment exports in 2017 By contrast all of Africa exported just us 12 billion However buyers are looking for new pouring locations because countries like China are increasingly focusing on their domestic market ii rising wage rates labour disruption travel banks and political unrest in current sourcing locations and iii increasing cost for social and environmental disruptions A 201516 survey of private label apparel retailers found that 37 were diversifying their country source of supply footprint while 28 planned to diversify in the future According to a 2015 survey chief purchasing officers of global buyers expect to increase the share of their purchases from Africa from 03 in 2015 to 28 by 2020 Moreover 70 said they expected to start sourcing and an additional 20 said they expected to increase the value of sourcing from Ethiopia by 2020 African countries enjoy market access to large developed markets Like countries lacs in Asia East African countries enjoy access to the European Union EU through the Everything but Arms agreement Unlike Asian lacs African countries can also sell garments to the United States US duty free through the African Growth and Opportunities Act ago East African countries are well positioned geographically The Middle East and Europe are nearby and fabric and other inputs may be shipped directly from Asia As buyers increasingly prize delivery speed East african proximity will become increasingly more important Governments in East African countries have made efforts to attract investment in garment production In Ethiopia and Kenya modern industrial parks IPs have been developed with garment industry needs in mind IP tenants enjoy lengthy tax holidays and are often provided special access to international inputs Source 1 World Trade Organization 2017 2 2016 3 mckinley 2015 Global Market Trend In 2017 the global apparel export market reached approximately us 478 billion marking a 4 increase from the previous year Notably 66 of the worlds apparel export was attributed to China the European Union EU and On the import side the

asian Export by Destination Asia 55 Source International Apparel Federation intranet Implications for Ethiopia While Asia continues to dominate textile and garment manufacturing apparel countries are increasingly looking to East Africa particularly Ethiopia as an alternative sourcing destination china Focus on Domestic Markets China currently responsible for nearly 33 of the sectors total exports is shifting more apparel production capacity towards its domestic market due to its substantial size and growing middle class This presents a significant opportunity for other countries to increase their share of the global market Factors Driving the Shift in Sourcing 1 Developments Shrinking labor size rising wages increased raw materials cost and shifts in foreign exchange rates are impacting sourcing decisions 2 Increasing Cost for Social and Environmental Disruptions Rising labor disputes reports of child labor poor working conditions travel bans and political unrest are pushing buyers to explore new sourcing locations In summary the global apparel market is undergoing shifts in both production and consumption patterns with East Africa including Ethiopia emerging as a potential alternative sourcing destination china focus on domestic markets and various social and environmental disruptions are influencing these changes in the industry Preferential Trade Agreements and Geographic Advantage in East Africa Preferential Trade Agreements East African countries like countries lacs in Asia benefit from access to the European Union EU through the Everything but Arms agreement Additionally East African countries can sell garments to the United States US under the African Growth and Opportunities Act ago providing a tariff advantage over Asian rivals Geographic Advantage East African countries have a favorable geographic location being near the Middle East and Europe Fabric and other inputs can be shipped directly from Asia The proximity of East Africa to major markets such as Europe and the Middle East becomes crucial as buyers increasingly prioritize delivery speed Implication for Ethiopia Africa and Ethiopia are better positioned to tap into the USA and EU markets due to these preferential trade agreements and the advantageous geographic location of East African countries Summary of Geographic Advantage in East Africa stands out with the shortest distance to Europe and relatively shorter distances over the Eastern USA coast making it strategically located for sourcing operations Distance to Major Markets in days to Europe 4547 days to Eastern USA 3637 days China nausea to Western coast of USA 2829 days to Western coast of USA 2832 days Vietnam to Western coast of USA 3034 days Implication for Shipping Routes The map shows that has the shortest distance to major destinations including Western and Eastern Europe and the Eastern USA coast making it a potentially strategic location for shipping routes Global Apparel Market evac Ecosystem The Global Textile and Apparel Value Chain evac ecosystem is a multifaceted network with several interdependent links spanning various geographic It encompasses a multitude of core and support actors and for the most part operates without stringent regulations relying on the coordination of core actors Key Components of the evac Ecosystem 1 Raw Materials Emphasis on global cotton production consumption and price Fibers used in the textile and apparel industry are either natural eg cotton wool or manmade eg polyester Cottons market share in textiles declined from 50 in the to 26 in 2016 while fibers share rose from 40 in 1990 to 68 in 2016 driven by technological advancements 2 Textile Process Involves various stages such as wineries yarn spinning weaving dyeing knitting and finishing Technological advancements and processes are crucial in transforming raw materials into usable textiles 3 Fashion Design Encompasses the creative and artistic aspects of designing apparel Involves the creation of clothing items based on trends consumer preferences and market demands 4 Consumers and Retailers Form the end of the value chain where finished apparel reaches the hands of consumers Retailers play a crucial role in marketing distribution and meeting consumer demands 5 Shipping Involves the transportation of goods from manufacturers to retailers and ultimately to consumers Efficient shipping is essential for meeting delivery timelines and customer expectations Global Context Raw Materials Natural fibers cotton wool and manmade fibers polyester are central to the textile and apparel industry Cottons market share declined over the years while fibers share increased driven by technological advancements Improved Seed Land Clearing and Labor These elements are part of the raw materials stage involving the cultivation and processing of natural fibers like cotton improved seed varieties and labor contribute to the agricultural aspect of raw material production Note This overview provides a glimpse into the evac ecosystem highlighting the critical stages and actors involved in the global apparel market Did you know It takes 3 years for farmers to

Harvesting 21 Fertilizers 22 allowed for enhanced productivity quality lower cost and greater diversity and consumers preference for synthetic or blended materials pesticides to clear the soil COTTON Production of cotton is highly primarily grown by farmers Harvesting is significantly manual but a shift is being made to mechanical harvest Worlds cotton production has been increasing in absolute terms 2148 in tons in 201516 2305 in Tons in 201617 to 2538 in tons in 201718 During 201718 world cotton production is projected to increase by 10 Higher cotton prices during 201617 and better cotton price ratios to other competing crops during the 2017 planting campaign resulted in the expansion of cotton area by an estimated 3 in ha to over 32 in ha 70 of the worlds cotton is produced by 4 countries Producers India China the United States and Pakistan are the worlds largest producers accounting for about 70 of global lint output ican 2017 During 201718 the largest gain in production of 23 to 46 in tons is projected in the USA Production is also projected to increase in all other major producing countries including India China Pakistan Brazil Africa and Turkey Exporters In 201718 world trade of cotton is projected to remain stable at 8 in Tons and the USA will remain the largest exporter accounting for 40 or 31 in tons of world shipments Consumption of cotton has continued to increase in absolute terms from 2418 in Tons in 20152016 to 2456 in Tons in 201617 2522 in Tons in 201718 The largest countries are also the largest consuming countries Importers Asia concentrates about 85 of the worlds imports China was by far the top importer from 2002 to 2015 but has been surpassed by and Vietnam in 2016 will remain the largest importer in 201718 accounting for 18 or 14 in tons of world imports Brands are increasingly strict on the sustainable production of cotton the industry is making efforts to find ways to produce fiber with less land less water less energy and fewer chemicals While organic and cottons remain niche products Better Cotton Initiative bi and Cotton made in Africa mia both launched in 2005 are successfully expanding market opportunities for more sustainable cotton bi production rose to 12 of global production in 2015 up from 75 in 2014 and aims to reach 30 of global production in 2020 Overview of textile process winning spinning weaving and knitting dyeing washing and finishing Global Context Cotton textile production is the most capital intensive industry in the value chain especially in the spinning weaving and finishing stages For example an integrated denim plant from spinning through fabric finishing costing roughly us 50 million would consume the equivalent of 19200 metric tons of seed cotton annually Compare this to the capital cost of approximately 13 million us required to process the seed cotton consumed in the denim plant Power quality and costs along with the cost of fibre and demand for fabric are key drivers of investment and production at this stage Yarn spinning Weaving dyeing Washing Knitting finishing Output Lint Yarn Woven or knitted fabric Dyed cloth Cloth ready for cut China dominates the world textile market emerging over the course of the last three decades followed by EU and India winning process of separating cotton fibre from seeds two technologies Roller winning gripping and stretching fibre through rollerblades simpler slower but gentle capacity per gin stand 40 to 110 keg winter side 175225 rotors 360 to 1000 is rotors Saw winning Pulling fibre with saws through ribs complex faster but harsher capacity per gin stand 1800 to 3400 keg winter Cost Difference between Roller and Saw winning Roller winning has higher investment costs that increase with capacity and floor area but offers lower operating costs Saw winning benefits from economies of scale and has lower operating costs but higher capital costs Spinning process of converting lint to yarn Spinning operation can produce 100 cotton yarn as well as blends with polyester or other manmade fibres depending on market requirements Two main technologies for spinning cotton yarns Ring spinning is a versatile process suitable for a wide range of yarns from coarse to fine and superfine yarn opened spinning is generally used to produce coarse yarns up to Ne 30 Cost Difference between Ring and Rotor Spinning Ring spinning has higher costs for raw material capital labour waste and auxiliary material Rotor spinning has lower costs across these factors Weaving knitting and finishing It is a heavily capital intensive operations While knitting is moderately capital intensive and is capable down to a much smaller size than weaving knitting is rarely done as a operation and is integrated with garment production Source 1 Strengthening the Cotton Textile and Apparel Value Chain in East Africa An Assessment Draft August 2014 said Trade hub East Africa International Cotton Advisory Committee cotton this month October 1 2017 Draft strategy and Roadmap Ethiopian National Cotton Development strategy 20172030 Apparel Production The textile and garment value chain involves various stages including the production of fabrics sewing thread buttons interlocking printing and labeling zippers packaging and exporting carton hanger etc Production Initially concentrated in one geography with vertical integration Innovation in it and logistics enabled companies to break the textile and garment value chain into its component parts and disperse it across several geographic Materials and Costing Materials trims packaging and washing constitute the bulk of the costing for any garment Competing on labor cost alone is a race to the bottom Actors Suppliers in the textile and apparel value chain mostly consist of sees invested in countries to benefit from cheap labor quotas and generous incentives provided by host countries Buyers There are three types of lead firms buyers based on their sourcing strategies and corresponding value chains Lead firms or buyers employ various apparel sourcing strategies Buyers are focusing more on branding and marketing shifting manufacturing responsibilities down the chain They increasingly require their suppliers to measure their environmental and social footprint Garment production involves various costs including fabric trims washing and packaging The Breakdown for a Pair of Mens Chino Pants Total Fabric cost Trim cost wash Packaging cost fob Price US 650 US 150 US 090 US 020 US 910 Production of a Cotton Shirt in US 475 US 170 US 105 US 090 US 915 Note 1 deprives available on the preceding sections Deep Dive on Production Initially garment production was concentrated in one geography vertical integration However since the companies broke down the production process into its component parts and decided where to locate each one based on competitive advantages Goods and services were produced by vertically integrated companies that owned all stages in the production process from raw material to retail Originally this vertical integration was due to limitations in communications and logistics making it difficult to coordinate extended supply chains Vertically integrated companies were often attached to their locations employing generations of workers from the same families Over time innovations in it and logistics allowed companies to disperse production geographically based on competitive advantage and value addition This shift was influenced by factors such as the availability of raw materials labor technology markets fiscal and trade incentives Today over 60 of global trade is in intermediate goods Future Trends New technologies eg ad Printing may make it possible to shift production back to final markets shortening the critical factor of time in the value chain Innovations in it and logistics have allowed companies to disperse production globally based on competitive advantage and value addition Trend in the Geographical Distribution of Production Companies broke the production process down into its component parts and decided where to locate each one leading to constant reconfiguration of the textile and garment value chain tac The end of the Agreement ma quota system in 1995 has contributed to the continuous evolution of the tac Deep dive on production Materials trims packaging and washing constitute the bulk of the costing for any garment competing on labor cost alone is a race to the bottom Costing sheet for the production of Cotton shirts and pants Competition should be focused on An examination of actual costing sheets for current materials and fabric rather than labor fabrics sewing thread button interlocking printing and labeling zipper packaging and exporting make up the bulk of the costing for any garment and that is where big savings can be made Competing on labor costs is to compete on 15 of the total FOB cost so the potential savings are small in comparison to those for materials trims and washing Components Total Fabric Cost Trim cost wash Packaging fob price Cotton shirts US 650 US 150 US 090 US 020 US 910 Chino Pants US 475 US 170 US 105 US 090 US 075 US 915 Secondly the more of the cost components that can be sourced locally the better That should reduce transport and administrative costs and save time It is therefore important to develop accessories trims labeling and packaging suppliers in Ethiopia This will require foreign investment in the short term but there are also opportunities for local sees in this regard Implications for Ethiopia Ethiopia has much more to gain by developing its capacity to compete in raw materials packaging and washing than in labor Deep Dive on Suppliers Suppliers in the textile and apparel value chain mostly consist of sees invested in countries to benefit from cheap labor quotas and generous incentives provided by the host countries Quota is generally allocated to countries that had little or no export capacity characteristics of and was denied to competitive exporting nations Input Characteristics of Suppliers in the Textile and Apparel Value Chain Suppliers in the textile and apparel value chain are often sees managed by family members rather than experienced professional managers The countries usually had limited or no resources raw materials textile mills dye houses washing facilities or suppliers of accessories and trims Much of the FDI went into export processing zones where companies imported all of their inputs and exported all the outputs This forced textile and apparel companies from quota countries eg China Hong Kong Korea and taipan to go abroad and relocate to countries such as cambodian guatemalans desoto Sri lana and swampland The quota system that prevailed under the Arrangement until 1994 However the FDI companies were mostly sees whose basic management system was only adequate for their home markets they were unprepared for the investment and labor markets in a foreign country Apparel Factories The textile and apparel operations would not have survived if not for the 4 availability of cheap labour quota frees and generous incentives provided by the FDI regimes in the host countries Garment Implications for Ethiopia when designing incentives and marketing the investment opportunities available in the country the aim should be to attract companies that have the capacity to manage their operations in a foreign environment and to create decent work opportunities in their own and local supplier facilities Deep dive on buyers There are three types of lead firms buyers based on their sourcing strategies and their corresponding value chains Type of Clothing Buyers Type of Buyers Description Examples Brand Manufacturers As the name suggests these brands are vertically integrated and engaged in manufacturing activities While some are involved all the way back to raw materials most focus on one or more stages of yarn and textile production cutting and sewing apparel and retailing Their numbers have decreased as brands opted to outsource overvalue functions concentrating on design marketing retailing and finance Some still manufacture but utilize suppliers and manufacturers to add capacity and flexibility of Hanes Brands Fruit of the Loom Hugo Boss Brand Marketers More typical for prime and luxury brands that aim to protect intellectual property and maintain quality They specialize in branding and marketing but not manufacturing This category includes former brand manufacturers that sold off their production operations like elvis and those founded by designers or entrepreneurs who never engaged in production activities eg Nike or patagonian They may or may not own their own retail outlets elvis Nike patagonian Retailers Divided into two those with their own label production eg palmar Marks Spencer teach and those who only sell their brands eg Gap and he Some discount and department store retailers have their label production while others like brand marketers drive global production networks without owning manufacturing facilities palmar Marks Spencer teach Gap he Deep dive on buyers Lead firms or buyers employ many different apparel sourcing strategies Lead firms brands retailers sourcing strategy Increase in functions Buyers chose from a magnitude number of suppliers relationship between buyer and supplier is services expertise and purely transactional and price driven Suppliers are competing for every order no trust or long term relationship built with the buyers fabrics non fabrics sewing thread button interlocking Market printing and labelling zipper packaging and exporting y carton hanger etc The supplier has done several transactions with the buyers and has developed trust based relationship Lead firm may invest in developing the technical capacities of the supplier to encourage the supplier Strategic partner Lead firm provides all the technical specification to the turnkey supplier which coordinate the system to deliver the buyers orders Transaction is based on more than price as buyers are reliant on the suppliers ability to manage produce and process standard and network of sub suppliers fold supplier Apparel Factories These are vertically integrated companies that own or control all stages of production from raw materials to final assembly and ya possibly even retail Output Garment Vertically integrated Implications for Ethiopia The country should develop its supplier base from the narrowest to the widest range of functions and

buyers buyers are focusing more on branding and marketing and shifting both manufacturing and non manufacturing responsibilities down the chain fabrics non fabrics sewing thread button interlocking printing and labelling zipper packaging and exporting carton hanger etc Apparel Factories Output Implications and Roles in the Value Chain Ethiopia must brand its value chain as socially and environmentally sustainable to attract buyers and retailers looking to shift costs and functions down the value chain Focus on core competence such as branding and marketing Construct the supply chain and impose costs and responsibilities on suppliers Suppliers failing to meet buyer requirements risk exclusion from the chain Suppliers Handling the full package gives suppliers more control over costs margins and time covering manufacturing roles procurement logistics and warehousing Some suppliers have developed design capacity offering services from design to delivery tasks include social and environmental compliance health and safety issues chemicals management and monitoring carbon and water footprints as well as security concerns Background Historically the production sharing model allowed the US to focus on textile manufacturing while Mexico handled assembly In Asia a full package arrangement emerged where suppliers in the region procured inputs cut sewed garments and delivered the final products to US brands Over the years more functions have been added to the full package including trade finance and logistics epi enhance competitiveness through switching from a narrow focus on cost advantages and lower standards to become champions of sustainable business until 2015 Buyers lead changing global trends exerting the greatest influence on where the industry sources International Garment Manufacturers Driven by buyer demands cost quality lead times compliance Buyers draw them into new markets for instance pah set up in harass IP and attracted 14 other companies manufacturers and suppliers Buyers influence location and involvement of various actors in the value chain In addition to lower costs buyers focus on sustainability and compliance along with shorter lead times based on experiences in other markets and customer preferences They seek markets where Local Garment Producers Often have lower quality due to lower domestic supply chain requirements Those aiming for export must meet buyer quality and compliance standards differentiating themselves based on these criteria Auxiliary Input Providers Sensitivity to buyer presence due to the need for high buyer concentration in an area for attractiveness Ethiopia has few auxiliary input manufacturers most buyers import their inputs Raw Input Providers Inputs starting with cotton must meet quality standards of buyers to be used in the export chain Locally produced cotton in Ethiopia is of lower quality than imports and is largely excluded from the export value chain Deep dive on sustainability Environmental social and economic sustainability form the three pillars of sustainability Sustainability A Social Ability of a system to function at a defined level of social wellbeing pollution creation and resource depletion Environmental Ability to maintain rates of renewable resource harvest indefinitely Economic Ability to support a defined level of economic production Deep Dive on Social Sustainability Main export platforms in emerging markets often face highly unstable labor situations as investors frequently underestimate and fail to quantify the impact of labor and social issues Incoming investors often underestimate and fail to quantify the impact of labor and social issues associated with their investments It is only when they reach full operating strength that they attempt to cope with symptoms of dysfunction such as absenteeism indiscipline errors and waste strikes and labor turnover However these coping mechanisms often lead to further conflicts as employers seldom conduct a root cause analysis to identify the real drivers of conflict Consequently they operate at low levels of efficiency and profitability constraining company revenues and workers pay Moreover from Central America in the West to the Philippines in the East many investment zones were designed to enable tenants to achieve export performance However zone authorities often undermine these efforts by failing to provide matching social infrastructure This issue generally stems from the division of labor in the host government The initiative to develop investment zones is usually taken by the trade or finance ministry with insufficient consultation with the ministries responsible for the labor market housing transport and social services Result Even in countries with a statistical of labor and attractive nominal wage rates ensuring a competitive supply of labor to zone factories can be challenging due to dysfunctional labor housing transport and other markets Workers often struggle to adapt to the rhythm and discipline of factory work facing difficulties in reporting to work on time and maintaining efficiency consistently hour after hour and day after day

investors frequently underestimate and fail to quantify the impact of labor and social issues Heightened awareness on adverse effects of wasteful Growing understanding of the business case of sustainability Sustainable production and use of products are the new norm Emergence of responsible innovation amongst the largest fashion companies Shifting paradigm on the role and responsibility of business in society Emergence of sustainability standards for the garment sector The speed of fashion is amplifying 5 fundamental problems in the industry high water consumption discharge of hazardous chemicals greenhouses emissions waste production and violation of human rights and labor standards Specifically for consumer products like garments the old paradigm of is making way for thinking or the circular economy The importance of assessing environmental impacts across the life cycle has become crucial from resource extraction manufacturing transportation to consumption and disposal Risk a complicated supply chain like garment there is an need to manage ESG risks covering the workplace marketplace community and the natural environment this is further accentuated in world where the average person can now assume a watchdog function naming and shaming brands Brand value of buyers can be easily lost if companies in are implicated in harm to rights child rights labor rights the environment or caught in corrupt or practices The ran Plaza disaster in is one stark reminder Cost minimization increasing need to minimize cost of production to remain competitive in the global market especially as the costs of raw materials energy and waste handling are increasing Resource Efficiency and Cleaner Production rep has been a tried and tested approach to help achieve that objective Access to conventional and niche markets responding to these issues has become an area of potential differentiation and creative inspiration Embracing design design for recycling some of the largest fashion companies such as he and Nike have publicly set sustainability goals and are carrying them in practice Example he has programmes to refurbish or recycle old garments and Nike also unveiled its European Logistics campus in Belgium founded on responding to sustainability challenges and maximising performance while minimising footprint Over the last 50 years traditional argument the business of business is business has been challenged and expanded to include stakeholders not just shareholders Importance of partnerships and collaborative governance is widely recognised and appreciated including the global community the UN national governments civil society academia and the private sector itself Driven mainly by buyers most important standards include ISO 9001 for companies ISO 14001 WRAP Developed countries also have such as the Blue Angel in Germany and the White Swan in scandinavian Globally consumers are a force to be reckoned with when it comes to boycotting bad but not much in rewarding good ones boycotting additionally the proliferation of various standards and has become confusing for the consumer There is a call to harmonise this space Note For more detail refer to annex 2 Deep dive on Economic sustainability Additionally apparel and textile sourcing countries should aim to the extent possible drive to have a localized value chain and self sufficient export Localised Value Chain Self Sufficient Export Foreign invested factories should forge backward and forward linkages in to the host economy to allow for the transfer of knowledge skill and technologies to the local players across the chain Local Small and Medium Enterprises should be incentivized and incapacitated to provide ancillary services to the Textile and Apparel sector Ownership of companies should gradually shift from Foreign to local based Import content of exports should go down and the domestic content of the exports should rise until a country is self sufficient Fashion Design Consumers Retailers consumers have become more sophisticated technology driven and harder to predict than ever with designer and retailers striving to keep up Fashion Design Accelerated pace of fashion is bearing pressure on creativity Accelerated pace of fashion industry cycles has increased the pressures bearing down on creativity It used to be Fashion designers which told consumers what to want now designers are taking more input from the buying and merchandising teams to react to what is selling rather than defining what will sell through forward looking design risks Additionally the reduced time between cycles has led to an increased in alleged plagiarism as the pressure to create new collections is as much a concern for mass market players as it is for luxury brands More collections and shorter design cycles are leading to high turnover among creative directors and putting strains on the creative process Ethical innovation offers a way forward product design is being transformed by consumers and brands who have prioritized sustainable fashion Consumer needs and behaviours have become more sophisticated more and harder to predict than ever Always connected and informed grown more comfortable with mobile online interaction which allowed them to consume apparel when where how and at price they like Retailers Rise of Omni channel and fast fashion require players to adapt to higher flexibility more collections the ability to deal with small batch sizes and quick responses commerce increase in digitization have decreased foot traffic in stores modern retailers are coping by diversifying and offering online shopping but not traditional retail channels Always on shopping around the clock millennials are demanding instant gratification More demanding seeking increasingly becoming sophisticated harder to predict and forcing retailers and brands to their needs rather than the other way around Shorter lead time Even fast fashion companies are adjusting their process to accommodate shorter design fashion they confirm orders at the last possible moment and take delivery as soon as possible to catch the fashion trend before it passes lead times are under constant pressure and have fallen from 120 days to 30 days in many markets This places enormous pressure on the manufacturers to increase productivity and efficiency while at the same time cutting costs More value conscious consumers increasingly becoming values oriented 2016 mckinley Global Institute Report estimates that more than 65 of consumers in emerging markets actively seek out sustainable products Sustainable production and consumption Buyers and supplies are increasingly monitoring and publishing their sustainability credentials Discount or office shoppers In 2016 discount shoppers accounted for 75 of apparel purchases across all channels Part of the reason why consumers have been able to seek discounts and promotions has been their uptake on commerce and digital tools which has created price transparency across brands and regions Focus on promotion and discounts traditional retailers have more outlet stores and discount stores than shops outlet malls set to double in number in China by 2020 Europe eg in UK six smackdown periods scheduled across the year and are also playing out in Germany and other EU countries Life style conscious new consumer lifestyle are trending driven by visualization exclusivity eg tenderness fashion plus size fashion modest wear for Islamic consumers from Middle East and South East Asia wellness programs Life style responses traditionally wellness and fashion have not been allied industries However recent trends have emerged with an way of dressing designed to be worn for exercising street wear and day wear Note For more detail refer to annex 3 There are additional support functions that determines the reliability and efficiency of the gave Custom and Clearance Transport Utilities Connectivity Access to Finance Export manufacturers are exposed to custom processes and regulations twice in each order cycle once when importing production inputs and again when exporting finished product it is crucial that there are no delays that can cause the consignment to miss delivery deadlines since that can lead to expensive airfreight and contractual penalties imposed by the buyer For this reason factory management need to be able to rely on fast customs clearance times and minimum delay in order to operate efficiently ensure that the production lines are fully loaded and that orders are completed on time The TA ve is driven by lead times and mandatory onetime deliveries Missing a shipping schedule exposes the manufacturer to large fines from the buyer and risks the entire order being cancelled Additionally when delivery of raw materials is held up it can stop the production process putting workers on short time and risking the loss of skilled workers as they migrate to factories that have work Efficient economical modes of transportation and logistics are thus critical Operations in textiles and garment requires sufficient and reliable access to water and energy The modern textile and apparel value chain needs constant connectivity between head office subsidiaries factories suppliers customs transport providers and markets production and fast fashion both require efficient and timely information sharing Virtually all transactions are handled via email or void calls In addition it also aid communication between supplier and buyers allowing for automated monitoring of orders stocks and prices travelling through the manufacturing and shipping process Enterprise resource planning integrates orders sourcing manufacturing account handling and logistics thereby helping companies optimize operations In addition modern it tools can allow manufacturers to track units throughout the production line in real time facilitating more effective monitoring As more and more machinery and equipment becomes digital the connectivity of processes will increase using the Internet of Things IoT and this calls for urgent investment in communications infrastructure and technology Given the competitive nature of the textile and apparel industry it is essential that raw materials accessories and trims be brought together in factories on a timely basis The increasing pressure on suppliers to shorten their delivery times and operate on a basis makes the planning and timing of material inputs purchase critical to success Where materials are imported any delays in accessing fore and Trade finance impacts the competitiveness and profitability of exporters In summary gave is under threat of disruptions owing to five major factors the future of gave is shorter faster more responsive more flexible and more sustainable than before Causes of Disruption Scarce natural resources Mismatch between demand for TA and limited natural resources needed for the sector land water energy resulting in environmental concerns related to emissions and waste Scarce human Quantitative and qualitative shortages of human resources becoming major constraints as a result of disintegrating national education and training systems and international migration of employable people to the best job markets Fourth Industrial Revolution Revolutionary change brought on by social and environmental concerns Automation and digitization of manufacturing processes that allow infinite and immediate adjustment of machinery enabling the production process to accommodate different styles and small volumes New Consumption Patterns and Business Models New consumption patterns for customized personalized and fast shopping experiences New business models and apps that allow customers to shop and personalize platforms such as Amazon or and guarantee overnight delivery New Forms of Regulation Increasing consumer demand for transparency and measurement of the

upgrade and diversify The East Asian economies that were able to upgrade and diversify from textiles and apparel to electronics and automobiles all had a central coordinating agency or ministry that served as a combination of policy maker and coordination mechanism for the line mi stories involved Japan The Ministry of International Trade and Industry mini played a key role in developing and implementing industrial policy especially during the period of reconstruction and growth from 1950 to the o mini regularly monitored the needs of the industry and coordinated closely with the companies and subsections that it was supporting Deliberation councils committees and study groups sometimes with the big industrial associations were all used to ensure that policy reflected the ever changing reality of industry and industrial strategies were revised every one or two years to ensure their pertinent mini in addition to strategy and coordination worked on issues that were beyond the scope of companies individually or collectively such as red infrastructure trade negotiations and overall business environment China After Deng Xiaoping launched the opening strategy in the late a State Council Office for Special Economic Zones and opening was created in order to conceptualize and implement the sees In 2003 the State Council Office for Restructuring the Economic System and the State Economic and Trade Commission were merged to form the National Development and Reform Commission narc a with 26 functional departments develops five year plans investment strategies industrial policies and economic restructuring programmes Singapore The Singapore Economic Development Board ed was also established in 1961 to attract investment and create jobs It became the lead government agency for planning and executing strategies to ensure singapore position in the global economy The ed envisions plans and delivers medium term strategies that position Singapore as a venue for investment originally in labour intensive manufacturing and later in capital intensive and industries Huo The Development and Investment Authority MEDIA later the Industrial Development Agency mid was established to develop additional industrial zones and promote manufacturing companies Key characteristics Statutory authority with roles combining planning strategy and coordination functions to promote FDI boost exports increase jobs and upgrade and diversify the economy Responsibility for the mobilisation and allocation of capital fore reform industrial policy and investment promotion deregulation or and later for dealing with such as sustainability and social responsibility Structure function and strategies of these agencies were not static and they evolved along with the changing political economic and social context in order to maintain their relevance There are examples of countries that developed competitive export sectors without a central coordinating agency to drive a clear strategy but those ad hoc or unplanned strategies have limitations The Board of Investment BOI was merged with the Privatisation Commission to form the Investment Development Authority bid in 2016 which is the principal private investment promotion and facilitation agency There are two industry associations one for woven products the Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association mea and one for knits the Manufacturers and Exporters Association mea that act as lobbies for the industry but issues such as red infrastructure logistics customs sustainability and skills are beyond their remit and receive inadequate attention eo The Export Processing Zones Authority has done a reasonable job of managing the epps but they have only developed eight zones in 30 years with a total of 497 tenants saw impressive growth in apparel exports from both locally and foreign owned companies but after 40 years they have failed to upgrade or diversify their exports They are concentrated in a small number of product categories and markets and highly vulnerable to external shocks The logistics system port and airport infrastructure are still far from competitive and customs remain a bottleneck 2 Have backward forward linkages been forged te ee The most complete and comprehensive value chain on the planet a model that every one aspires to emulate Gov applied four strategies to develop the TA ve Bring In Go Up Go West Go Out Government drove the development of the full value chain by offering incentives that rewarded foreign and Chinese investors who sourced inputs locally Government also offered incentives to encourage the development of local red new technology and higher value addition Government promoted the development of clusters and by 2010 there were 146 TA clusters ma quota required both assembly and finishing take place in whereas the come Convention that provided for quota and access to the EU market specified that both assembly and one pre assembly process take place in the country As a result almost all apparel exporters had backward linkages to yarn or textile mills and many were vertically integrated US requirements taught exporters process skills while those of the EU market obliged them to acquire a wider range of functional skills and capacities Limited supplies of cotton only produces some 3 of the cotton required by the TA ve relies on neighbor India Imports of cotton cost US 3 in pa Imported cotton Government provided incentives for the import of cotton and investment in textile manufacturing to make up for the shortage of raw materials yarn and fabric but the industry remains dependent on cotton imports 800000 it of cotton in 2012 Initially all fabric accessories and trims had to be imported the knit sector has developed local supply Government has recently incentivized other backward linkages but investment has yet to materialize Vietnam Heavily dependent on imported raw cotton manmade fibres yarns fabrics and accessories Imported materials made up about 80 of the total export garment value between 2007 and 2011 and still account for around 70 vietnam does produce some yarn and textiles but the quantity and quality are too low to meet export requirements Local cotton producers supply only 004 percent of the textile sectors demand There is insufficient dyeing and finishing capacity and this acts as a major constraint In anticipation of top and the vietnam fats yarn forward rule that requires all production steps of export apparel to be sourced in member countries Chinese Korean and Taiwanese companies started investing in yarn and textile mills Vietnamese sees are mostly sub contractors to FDI vendors who receive the orders from international brands and retailers Some of the more capable sees may receive FOB orders directly from international buyers but they are limited 3 Has the sector upgraded diversified and increased value addition 7 Se Yes both as a result of government policy and incentives and inclusion in global value chains Gov drove the expansion of the sector in the and the upgrading after 2000 The value added in the TA ve increased 13 pa from 19802008 in real terms Gov encouraged upgrading by providing fiscal tax rebates and financial infrastructure incentives Gov also set higher technical standards and targets for value addition creating a market for upgrading Because Sri lana was small they did not try to compete with volume producers like China and India They specialized in higher fashion content garments and intimates they used air freight to reduce economic distance They were initially dependent on import for exports but they started with cut and then added more functions and services to upgrade shorten the supply chain reduce time and cost and extract more value As labor and other costs rose some exporters moved up the ladder and produced higher value added items such as Scottish whereas others relocated production to Madagascar and continued to produce basics relying on the lower cost structure of their neighbor rig exports are still concentrated in a few low product categories and essentially unchanged between 19902010 Within the dominant basics category there has been a relative shift from woven to knits In the early the ratio of woven to knits was 8515 but by 2015 it had become almost 5050 mainly because of the stronger backward linkages in the subsection 2001 and 2010 the average unit price of rig exports fell by US for knits and by US for woven Unclear if will remain competitive in sectors which are highly price sensitive may start to lose price competitiveness and hence orders as it invests to improve factory safety and workers welfare Additionally upgrading to higher fashion content is difficult as it is far from major markets and lead times are too long They may however be able to do higher value added constructed garments that are not fashion sensitive 2015 undo study reported that while Vietnam had experienced impressive growth in exports the amount of value added fell by half from 203 to 132 between 2006 and 2013 70 of the 2500 garment exporters are working on a cut basis at the bottom of the value chain and only some 20 are doing FOB production Some 9 are doing original design manufacturing odd and 1 are engaged in original brand manufacturing bom High of sees and old does in the sector are holding back investment in upgrading and diversification Additionally lack of upgrading both technology and human resources and import dependence are limiting the number of orders received from international buyers The added value of textiles and garments in Vietnam is very low vietnam role in the global supply chain does not occupy an important position the only advantage Vietnam has over others is our affordable source of labour of the Vietnam Textile and Apparel Association 4 Was there transfer or localization of skill and technology from FDI Domestic Led FDI esp from Korea was important catalyst the industry is comprised of two parts with FDI mainly in the epps and locally owned exporters mainly in the domestic tariff area data Overall some 95 of export units are locally owned There has been a significant skill and knowledge transfer Managers workers trained by foreign companies mainly Korean went on to work for other companies or founded their own Pressure from foreign buyers trade unions nos is and gov led to extensive programs of social audit certification and reporting that led to improvements to production organization management FDI LED Limited localization vietnam export growth is largely driven by FDI and it accounts for 72 of vietnam total exports at present The same is true for the leather and footwear sector where the industry association least notes that FDI manufacturers account for over 80 of the leather and shoe exports because companies lack the resources to expand production or market share There has not been technology or skill transfer localization takes the form of vendors placing orders with local suppliers but this has not enabled the local sees to upgrade FDI LED Extensive localization FDI came from Hong Kong entrepreneurs looking to escape quota restrictions and from India but much of the capital for martian export production was raised locally martian investors were prominent and by 1995 a full 50 of the equity involved in export production was local Managers trained by foreign owned firms went on to found local firms The growth of the export sector raised total factor productivity after 1990 and well into this century Yes thanks in part to the established by Martin Trust and by companies such as yak sequel Triumph Speedo and elwood Sri lana has developed some textile capacity and now supplies about 25 by value of its fabric needs However the lack of raw materials high cost of machinery and expensive electricity discourage investment in the sector Sri lana benefits from the proximity of India and other regional suppliers of fabric China and Hong Kong Sri lana has excellent sea and air connections and a lot of Indian cargo is actually in Sri lana so frequent delivery options existed This regional supply chain meant that the lack of backward linkages was not a constraint 5 What challenges did the country face across vics China started with a very weak economy in

Case Studies issue Areas Biding Constraints issue Area Recommendation Based on the extensive assessment desk review and stakeholders consultations five categories of binding constraints were identified 12 Category Constraint Supporting Evidence Workforce Customs and Logistics Shortage of foreign currency low fore liquidity delays importation and expansion plans For exporters this shortage is driven by inability to retain export earnings Low liquidity in the banking sector and high perceived risk of the TA sector causes high interest rates and long approval times for financing The domestic bank system has high la and fore conversion costs and is prone to delays Majority of the population is agrarian making it difficult to source skilled workers Low efficiency of available labour reducing cost advantage efficiency is further lowered by high turnover Institutions do not provide sufficient workers vet graduates are not receptive to operator work Current training programs do not meet the labour demand and are not effective at imparting soft skills Import lead times are long and expensive compared to benchmark countries lead times are affected by both customs clearance and logistics transportation Customs processing is inefficient and leads to delays in customs and port handling Clearance systems lacks standards timelines for clearing imported goods are highly variable Inland transportation from factory to port is expensive Manufacturers report waiting up to 6 months to receive information on loan approval status Exporters are currently allowed to retain 30 of earned fore beyond 28 days which is insufficient for their operations Bank conversion costs range from 5 to 7 which is substantially higher than fees charged elsewhere eg 1 in China 045 in Vietnam Low average worker line efficiency efficiency can go as low as 25 compared to 46 in Turnover ranges from 10 upwards some manufacturers in hole semi industrial park indicate up to 70 turnover Manufacturers cite that existing training initiatives do not meet even half of the demand Exporting from Ethiopia is 24 times more expensive compared to competing markets like Manufacturers indicate

ensures symbiosis with neighbouring and access to social amenities for workers Parks face unreliable and expensive internet water and power although power provision is now more consistent There is a lack of standards for driving social and environmental compliance across all parks Although tide offers technical support there is limited tailored support incentives to meet needs of firms that surpass the typical domestic firm There is a lack of guidelines to promote or measure degree of effective knowledge transfer The subcontract market remains relatively unregulated Garment producers import all their inputs which fails integrate the local industry into the export supply chain Cotton sector faces lower quality and higher prices compared to imports and low production levels winning is hindered by outdated equipment lack of quality control processes and high financing needs Locally produced auxiliary inputs do not meet quality standards of exporters Workers in parks do not have access to housing schools and child care or recreational facilities etc within reasonable distance form parks harass plans to employ 30000 workers but plans were only developed to create housing for 500 workers harass is the only park that has been designed to achieve high standards of environmental compliance Manufacturers cite unique challenges that go beyond support that is currently offered Although incentives exist to hire expat staff manufacturers note that the 3 year period is too short and cultural differences hinder knowledge transfer Existing cotton variety slows machines causes

Interviews with garment producers indicate they have tried to source auxiliary inputs locally but opted to import due to low quality There are also an additional three thematic areas that present opportunities for addressing the sectors challenges Institutional Arrangements Current set of incentives dont address fundamental operational challenges that hinder performance eg access to fore customs efficiencies etc Current incentives are not performance based and its effects are difficult to measure Incentives are not tailored to the specific type of stakeholders Pursuit of relationships with international investors has not been active and aggressive As Ethiopia is still nascent in TA exports it has not yet achieved quality and capability standards that set it apart from competitors TA sector is dependent on several government institutions many of which do not have a specific mandate to promote the sectors growth Although a mechanism for coordination exists across these institutions conflicting priorities limit the ability to take specific actions Use of data for effective is limited Manufacturers and buyers cite appreciation for current incentives but indicate that these are not the key drivers that draw them to the country they would prefer for challenges on fore customs and logistics and workforce to be addressed The level of investment by buyers and manufacturers is still low the country did not meet its TA export targets for 2017 Ethiopia has not yet fully built international recognition as a goto country for higher or compliance Ethiopia is

exporters In spite of these efforts access to fore remains the main banking challenge facing investors long term solutions will need to address the fore issue Input suppliers outside of parks are

sourcing skilled workers as most of the workforce is only beginning to shift from a traditional agrarian society to industrial work There is inconsistency in efficiency rates one international factory

Skills Lessons from the Skill Development Experiences of Singapore 2000 Enterprise Partners stakeholders interviews Ethiopia faces a structural challenge to industrialization majority of the population is agrarian which makes it difficult to source skilled workers As a result the TA sector experiences various challenges Low rates of labour efficiency varies from factory to the next one international factory indicates reaching efficiency levels similar to 4748 while others experience rates as low as 25 Low efficiency is due to low technical machine mechanic and skill level and familiarity with factory work It limits progression to higher quality and higher fashion products and consequently the range manufacturers can provide buyers Absenteeism from work resulting from poor attitudes towards work and structural challenges eg transport Efforts are being made to address the skills gap through training programs supported by partners such as the World Bank GIZ and Enterprise Partners Despite these efforts factories are still faced with challenges in meeting demand low efficiency and poor soft skills from workers Create a human resource development fund to support factories with training Employers would pay a levy of 1 of their workers payroll towards a skills fund to support training Options for deployment of funding Grants for training Funding is given to preapproved public or private training service providers who apply for funding The grants are self sustaining because they boost employment and hence the volume of the payroll levy Recommended option as it has low administrative burden and has proved effective for training needed to build the skills base Reimbursement for training the fund reimburse a portion of training expenses for service training on or offsite but needs a higher level of administration Train or pay schemes Exemptions from levies for firms that train workers Not ideal as firms already provide some training Representation the fund should have a high autonomy with employers having majority seats on the Board to ensure the fund matches industry needs and does not become too bureaucratic Implementation tide

practical and short term courses 16 months to meet the labour demand at operator level Equipping with the relevant machines to provide training at the scale required Global experience highlights how skills funds can be leveraged to improve worker skills and efficiency The skills levy has been implemented in more than 60 countries and has been an effective way of encouraging companies to train and retrain their Malaysia The Human Resources Development Fund had is an organization under the Human Resources Ministry of Malaysia with a mandate to catalyze the development of competent local workforce A payroll levy of one percent for employers with 50 employees or 05 percent for small enterprises that wish to participate is used for partial reimbursement of approved training expenses Those who have contributed a minimum of six months are then eligible to claim a portion of allowable training expenses up to the limit of their levy payments for the year In addition the had provides

auxiliary input industry can be improved in several ways Provide incentives for joint ventures and auxiliary input providers who supply to exporting apparel manufacturers to encourage upgrading of quality standards to meet export demand eg preferential financing and scrapping of taxes paid on imports for auxiliary input manufacturers Low quality of local products drives importation of auxiliary inputs eg cartons carton boxes zippers etc by apparel manufacturers Local auxiliary input providers are not exposed to the quality requirements of the export market and lack the relationships with manufacturers to provide access to this Low number of both local and international input producers international producers are hesitant to enter the market until it achieves greater scale as they are heavily dependent on demand from apparel manufacturers Bring in expatriates to conduct quality enhancement trainings for companies that are unable to afford them In the long term once quality has improved consider introducing local Local producers lack incentives to produce for the export market since they still pay sourcing quotas for inputs for apparel manufacturers import duty as indirect exporters Auxiliary inputs are the easiest point in the value chain to incorporate local players in terms of both time and financial investment required For example in 2009 produced only 2 of the cotton needed in the country compared to 80 of accessories supports backward linkages by providing local sourcing incentives eg 15 cash subsidy of the fabric cost to exporters sourcing fabrics locally a similar arrangement could be provided for auxiliary inputs in Ethiopia In Sri lana joint venture companies have enabled small firms to specialize in various services requiring handiwork and helped upgrade them to a level where they are comfortable placing orders with them This happened due to the exclusive availability of export quotas to small firms and the prohibition of quota sales which

capability to invest in new equipment new equipment requires high capital investment Machinery imports are only duty free in the establishment phase after which import duty is charged on machinery and spare parts Domestic industry players also identify difficulty securing financing as a key barrier to growth Lack of quality standards and processes eg in handling and storage This is also caused by low technological knowhow of existing facilities driven by low cotton supply and declining The winning sector is classified as a services industry and as a result does not receive incentives available to manufacturers Like winning the local textiles industry is largely unable to meet export quality requirements Local fabric mills are few in number and unable to supply the apparel industries from locally produced fabric Value adding technologies required for the export market are not performed and would require additional investment in machinery and technical knowledge and skill even the

500000 ha the area under cultivation is expected to decrease to 60000 due to farmers switching to other crops eg sesame because of erratic weather conditions and susceptibility of the dominant cotton variety to pests Security and land use rights pose challenges for investors interested in large scale farming clear rules on land property rights do not exist and land acquisition is a complex and constantly shifting process causing investors to fear displacement of occupants conflict with communities and the associated reputation risk High prices local cotton is 10 more expensive than imports because of low quality impacting processing lack of transparency in pricing and low availability Ethiopia has the advantage of having agricultural land conditions to grow cotton this should be maximized even though benefits to the industry will manifest in the long term Revamp the existing research centre for cotton The capabilities of the center should be enhanced to help growth of better cotton varieties through production of improved seeds testing accreditation and quality assurance The centers mandate should include supporting training of farmers and wineries on best practices of handling cotton and can leveraging tides support Promote FDI in cotton farming as this is likely to have higher roll than targeting farmers due to scale Work with regional authorities to streamline

niche markets over cheap production Domestic production was unable to provide the range of material and designs needed to accommodate the changes in demand and styles that occur several times a year for value added and fashion apparel due to cost and capacity issues As a result Sri lana prioritized flexible importation of fabrics over full integration into the textiles industry viewing ability to from the most competitive supply source as a key success factor However Sri lana has successfully developed backward linkages in ancillary inputs as this did not require as heavy an investment as

takes place for example in India a notification was issued in 2003 by the Central Board of Excise and Customs specifying when and how subcontracting can take place It outlines that subcontracting outside the zone is allowed based on the approval from a customs officer It also places limits on the amount that can be subcontracted based on the free on board value and requires that proof of the necessity to subcontract production in a domestic tariff area be submitted as per the discretion of the customs officer Source stakeholders Interviews Central Board of Excise and Customs Notifications

challenges Global experience shows that 1 incentives that address operational challenges are attractive to dis and 2 tax incentives can be successfully undertaken and Malaysia are examples of successful countries attracting investment that offer many advantages to investors other than tax breaks such as stable economic and political conditions a well educated labour force good infrastructure open trade for exporters dependable rule of law and effective investment promotion systems Indonesia undertook an ambitious tax reform in 1984 The company tax rate was reduced from 45 per cent to 35 per cent and selective tax incentives were totally eliminated including tax holidays preferential rates special investment allowances and selective accelerated depreciation The number of FDI projects dipped in that year but then climbed rapidly for the rest of the decade Similarly in China although the type and extent of incentives offered varies by province city and zone where investment is located as these administrative units have significant autonomy the various incentive schemes have also changed over the years Generally the type and extent of tax exemptions and deductions are now tied to specific performance indicators such as the size of the investment period of operation percentage of export introduce incentives to ensure that incentives are specifically tied to ethiopian national sector priorities Set metrics and targets Set national priorities as a measure of performance eg Increase fore employment value addition local sourcing exports etc Set performance targets based on national priorities Develop a set of specific incentives tied to measurable performance around each of the targets Introduce new set of incentives and phase out incentives

basic products in the short term while building capacity required to produce higher fashion apparel in the long term As the market shifts to respond to online retail market brands who have a greater market share lead times are becoming increasingly important Ethiopia will need to offer more valued solutions to brands to remain competitive Historical trends indicate that most countries that have upgraded product types from basics to higher fashion content over long duration eg China upgraded gradually after establishing the basics industry Sri lana and Turkey have managed to upgrade relatively quickly largely due to strong relationships and joint ventures with brand marketers Overall product upgrading requires the following factors Increased investment in machinery and logistics has largely done through foreign investment Higher apparel experience quick changes in demand and styles and have shorter lead times Developing relationships with strategic buyers Building a strong skills base higher fashion products are more complex and require higher levels of skill to produce Incentives Promotion Changes ethiopia should take a phased approach by building capacity in basics and using those to transition to higher fashion products Products In the short term focus on achieving scale in basic items that that require less effort to start eg basic cotton product items such as knit shirts woven shirts and denim products These are competitive and have future prospects they are always in demand In the medium to long term use the basics platform to enhance skills technology in higher fashion production This will improve the industry resilience to the threat posed by automation production of basics is easier to automate Specialisation does not limit Ethiopian apparel producers rather it helps maximize existing potential while new capacities are developed Basic product categories with the same style can still be produced for different price points and levels of fashion content Capabilities Conditions country do not currently support a shift to FOB limited supply chain integration low access to fore despite high dependence on imports and inefficient customs and logistics However as these challenges are addressed the industry should look to go beyond cut assembly and offer more value add solutions eg full supply chain management and design Execution
