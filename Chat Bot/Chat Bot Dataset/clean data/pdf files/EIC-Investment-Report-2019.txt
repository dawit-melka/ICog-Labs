What is worth noting is the increasing concentration of FDI in manufacturing activities which demonstrates that ethiopians exported industrialization strategy anchored in the manufacturing sector is working and will lift the country up in the development ladder and matchup with economies In the current global economic environment it is difficult to predict how the global FDI flows and trends will unfold in the coming years According to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development global FDI flows have been on a downward slide since which partly explains the slight decline in FDI flows to some African countries including Ethiopia in 2018. It seems that this sliding trend along with the impact of the on investment flows and the smooth operation of the global supply chains may continue to dampen foreign investors plans to initiate new investments however at nice we are confident that Ethiopia will attract increased FDI in the course of 2020 and the amount will exceed the peak reached in 2017. Our confidence and conviction is based on the following reality the initiation of a homegrown economic reform programme which has already begun to stabilize the policy environment the launch of the Perspective plan mapping the policy direction and the priority pectoral pillars for the rest of this decades the opening of sectors that were previously closed to foreign investors and Ethiopian the government s decision to privatize major enterprises the completion within the next two years of industrial parks that are currently under construction the dividend and goodwill generated from the peace process that our Prime Minister has initiated and the dynamism of a new leadership in Ethiopia with a vision to take the country into a higher stage of development These are some of the building blocks that will help us position our country as an attractive location for quality investment Aware of this potential we at nice have begun to introduce the tools and capacities that we need to create an investment promotion agency and capable of contributing to the country development vision During we will conduct a series of capacity building measures aimed at improving our statistical management capability investment promotion skills and our ability to reach out to potential investors targeting those we wish to attract We are currently developing a new investment promotion strategy that will reflect the new investment laws and regulations We have introduced an online licensing system to ease the process for new investors and will continue to use digital technology as an effective tool for investment promotion and facilitation Strengthening our working relationship with regional investment will be given top priority including through the application of digital technology to consolidate information on investors gathered by different regions We are currently developing an services strategy based on best practice experiences to help us upgrade our work on investment facilitation monitoring the contributions of FDI to job creation export growth and capability building through linkages and provide the necessary support as the need arises This will include supporting foreign investors in industrial parks working closely with the Industrial Parks Development Corporation We will also strengthen our analytical capability to ensure that the actions we take are based on informed evidence and reflective of the reality on the ground wish to take this opportunity to thank other institutions public and private and development partners who collaborated with us and made our efforts to attract and retain investment possible Above all 1 wish to thank the staff at EIC for their dedication and commitment in translating our mission hope and

Proclamation to promote greater investment within the country few Trends in FDI flows to Ethiopia African economies can draw on a range of external sources of finance including Overseas Development Assistance loans private and public remittance portfolio equity investment and Foreign Direct investment For many FDI has been the most reliable and largest source of external finance It has also been an important source of technology transfer access to management skills marketing network and a major driver of export trade FDI inflow into African countries has risen sharply in the last two decades in line with improvements in economic performance and a growing global demand for African products Ethiopia has been one of the countries that has attracted substantial amount of did however despite economic growth since early it was only after 2012 that Ethiopia began to attract FDI in quantities commensurate with the country economic size and growth performance Between 2003 and for example ethiopians gap growth rate was an unprecedented 10.3 per cent on average up from less than 3 per cent annual growth during the previous ten years and much faster than the average annual growth in Africa as a whole nearly 6 per center Ethiopia was one of the fastest growing economies in the word and even the global financial crisis of and the subsequent collapse in global commodity prices did not hinder ethiopians growth drive man The impressive growth performance had a positive impact on the country economy ethiopians per capita income increased over twofold during the same period albeit from a very low based The country headcount poverty ratio the percentage of its population living on an income of under per day in pop terms fell by more than half meeting the Millennium Development Goals target well before 2015. These improvements were underpinned by a steady increase in public investment in agriculture education health and road development and a shift in industrial strategy towards exported industrialization anchored in the manufacturing sector and based on inputs from agriculture Transition from the least to the most favoured FDI destination in East yet FDI inflow during the initial period of growth was consistently below the level expected for a country that was growing above the global average As shown in Figure between 2000 and Ethiopia was the least favourite FDI destination country in East african attracting in most years below million despite the country outstanding economic performance and a growth rate far above any country in the African region and the developing world as a whole FDI inflow in East Africa Millions of dollars at current prices 0 2000 2001 2 Ethiopia Kenya so wanda else ganda United Republic of tanzanian Figure 1. FDI Inflow in East Africa source united Database however ethiopians fortune as an FDI destination began to change around 2012. Since then FDI inflow to Ethiopia have been growing by 50 per cent per year on average reaching the peak of billion in 2017. While FDI inflow to Ethiopia declined slightly in 2018 in line with the global downward trends and the slowdown in global economic growth Ethiopia was still the largest recipient of FDI in the East African region and the fifth largest recipient of FDI in Africa after egypt South african Congo and Morocco figure 2 next page 13 Developing economies in Africa FDI flows Top 5 host Economies flows by range Above 5201082960 51.960 1 Below Top 5 host economies Economy Value of inflow 2018 change Figure 2. FDI inflow Top 5 Host Economies source WIR 2019 In fact in Ethiopia absorbed about half of the FDI inflow to East african the total quantity received that year was 3 times larger than the country in the group the Republic of tanzanian moreover in ethiopians stock of FDI was larger than any other country in the region after remaining well below other countries during the first decade of 2000. Once again the cutoff period for the sudden increase in the stock of FDI in Ethiopia was FDI stock in East Africa What are the explanations for the surge in FDI flows to ethiopian What has been the impact on pectoral distribution of FDI and its contributions to domestic productive capacity building Domestic From Figure it is evident that ethiopian rapid growth inthe period was not driven by FDI but largely by domestic investment particularly public investment in key sectors such as agriculture infrastructure construction and the services sector During this period public investment in infrastructure alone reached around 20 per cent of gap billion which was large relative to the size of the economy and compared to FDI flows to ethiopian The massive public investment helped to fuel domestic demand and enhance the economy productive potential At that time the most important source of external finance was not FDI but ODA and remittance which helped to complement public investment particularly in social sectors Rising international commodity prices also helped to increase merchandise exports at an average annual rate of 10.5 per cent between 2004 and 2009. obviously these favourable external environments helped to sustain the growth momentum In contrast however the role of FDI in ethiopians growth process during the first decade of this century was minimal Industrial Parks in Ethiopia IP The turning point in FDI The turning point for FDI inflow came when the country was preparing to implement its first Growth and Transformation Plan gap which coincided inflow of foreign investment from nontraditional investors in the south particularly turkey China and indian and the establishment and inauguration of the first industrial park in Ethiopia the Eastern Industrial Zone built by a Chinese private company the group With hindsight the construction and operation of the ein was instrumental in influencing the government s decision to build publicly owned industrial parks as policy instruments to attract export oriented for FDI and promote exports of goods In this respect the decision to construct industrial parks was a step change in the evolution of ethiopians industrial policy and exported industrialization strategy Industrial parks are specially designated economic sites containing all the necessary support systems and the basic infrastructure and services such as energy water transport connection logistics production sheds etc that enterprises need to manufacture goods for export The readily availability of these essential provisions and administrative services within a confined area makes industrial parks the most preferred investment sites for did They minimize the and the cumbersome Phase Eastern Industry Zone harass ip Phase II of Ethiopia kenya ganda United Republic of tanzanian wanda Figure 3 FDI Stock in East Africa source united database 15 initiating investment especially in countries where the administrative system is still underdeveloped and basic infrastructures are not widely available or accessible throughout the country It was not surprising therefore that the first Growth and Transformation Plan gap identified industrial parks as one of the main policy instruments for driving the exported industrialization agenda Since the government has constructed twelve industrial parks and the total number including private industrial parks has reached nineteen The plan is to construct a total of 30 industrial parks by the end of 2025. The parks are expected to attract investment into selected and largely activities The priority sectors include textile and apparel leather products pharmaceutical products and information and communications technologies The first three sectors were selected to maximize ethiopians comparative advantages The selection of the pharmaceutical sector and the construction of the Pharmaceutical Industrial Park was based on a dual objective of creating capacity and attracting investment The rationale for establishing the it Park in addis ababa in 2011 was to serve as the major driver of ethiopian Digital transformation agenda and attract investment in IT products and services not The sudden surge in FDI flows to Ethiopia since 2012 is undoubtedly related to the shift in industrial policy particularly the decision to establish art industrial parks containing all the services and infrastructure necessary for investment The parks have so far served as magnets pulling FDI into the country at a rate unprecedented in the country recent history More importantly however they have been instrumental in triggering new trends in the role of FDI in the country Three of these trends are worth highlighting Manufacturing as a source of FDI first increasingly FDI in Ethiopia is concentrating in the manufacturing sector which is exceptional for a and African economy In most developing countries FDI is dominant in the agricultural and service sectors currently on average about 60 per cent of FDI flows to Ethiopia goes to the manufacturing sector This makes Ethiopia one of a handful African countries where the bulk of FDI stock is invested in the manufacturing sector largely due to investment attracted into the industrial parks This is good news for ethiopian It illustrates that the Government s ultimate objective of growth with structural transformation and sustainable development by encouraging investment flows into productive sectors is working Trends in FDI flows in the manufacturing sector in Billion us 2014 2015 2016 2017 did FDI flow to the manufacturing sector a FDI flow to the other sectors Figure 4 FDI in Ethiopia in Billion us source EIC 2018 The surge in The contribution of FDI to domestic capital second increased FDI flows to manufacturing sector represent a surge in what is often referred to as investment which is investment in new and productive investment projects These are the types of FDI that countries prefer to attract because of their positive impact on job creation introduction of new technology and sometimes new products Announced investments in textile and leather sectors Country Amount 2656 Vietnam 869 China 466 Ethiopia 306 Indonesia 193 India 157 Russian Federation 150 cambodian 149 Mexico 140 serbian 129 France 92 mandar Fit United Kingdom 65 Egypt 50 bosnian and 47 Finland 46 bears 39 Dominican Republic 30 Table 1. Announced Projects Millions us source united database Globally announced investment has been on a longterm downward slide for the last decades In african Ethiopia is one of a few countries where announced investment has been rising in recent years linked to increased investment in industrial parks According to for example in Ethiopia was among the top five countries in the world that have attracted a significant amount of investment into the textile clothing and leather sectors table my third the upsurge in investment flows to Ethiopia has implications for productive capacity building through its impact on Gross Fixed Capital Formation off measures the net investment in fixed capital which is indicative of how much a firm or a country is developing its productive capacity ultimately economic development is not about achieving high level growth only as is often assumed but also about building the productive capacity that a country needs to produce a wide range of products and services for domestic consumption andlor to export competitively While it is possible to achieve growth without necessarily making significant progress in productive capacity building in the longterm the growth achieved will be unsustainable without productive capacity building The latter requires a process of capital accumulation and investment in fixed capital off measures the net increase in fixed domestic capital generally countries with rapid rates of economic growth tend to devote a higher percentage of gap to investment most of it invested in fixed assets including technology to enable them to improve productivity and achieve economic growth The more countries increase net investment in fixed capital and replace old technologies by new and emerging technologies the more likely that these countries accumulate productive capability and achieve sustained growth FDI inflow as a percentage of Gross Fixed Capital Formation 10.1 1.8 2010 2011 2012 Formation Figure 5 presents the share of FDI in off in ethiopian It is evident that the proportion of FDI flows as a percentage of domestic capital formation in the early growth years was insignificant however as FDI inflow increased the share of FDI in total off rose rapidly and significantly from less than 2 per cent in 2012 to 15 per cent in suggesting that FDI has become a major contributor to domestic capital formation and productive capacity building As FDI inflow declined slightly in the last two years there has been a downward slide in the share of FDI to however it remains higher than the average for African countries The way The world is on a slow and uneven growth trajectory with uncertainties on the future of the trading system and the impact of the on investment flows and the smooth operation of the Global Value Chains It is difficult to predict the trend in global FDI flows in such uncertain times however given the intensity and scope of the economic reforms that are currently underway in ethiopian which includes a major overhaul of investment laws and the privatization of major enterprises and the completion of a number of industrial parks that are currently under construction it is expected that in the course of Ethiopia will attract greater amounts of FDI exceeding the peak reached in 2017. 12.1 9.7 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 Be Africa Ethiopia Figure 5 FDI inflow as a Percentage of Gross Fixed Capital Over the past 15 years the Ethiopian economy reforms to correct go registered a growth rate and over a three foreign exchange imbalances fold increase in per capita income Growth was pro control inflation safeguard poor as reflected in a significant poverty reduction financial stability while promoting and improvements in access to education health and and ensuring debt infrastructure This remarkable progress was made sustainability possible through a public investment agenda aimed at A building critically needed human and physical capital Structural reforms to ease is institutional and structural apt a ensure debt suitability Sustaining this significant progress requires correcting bottlenecks to productivity and imbalances easing structural and job growth and reduction institutional bottlenecks to doing business and A A A creating new sources of jobs and productivity growth pectoral reforms to address Refine ty O To assist with these adjustments the Government of institutional and market failures of Ah sake AN Ethiopia has launched a comprehensive and well inhibiting productivity growth in EE coordinated homegrown economic reform agenda key strategic sectors aimed at stabilizing the country economy within the next three years The hometown reform agenda has Key priority sectors where reforms are particularly three pillars targeted include agriculture manufacturing tourism challenges not mining and it Figure 5.

This outcome suggests that the numerous policy adjustments investment policy reforms and industrial policy measures for example the establishment of industrial parks that the government introduced over the last decade had minimum impact on improvements in the administrative and regulatory environment for starting a business in ethiopian The World Bank s ease of doing business is a widely accepted indicator for measuring the domestic policy environment and administrative procedures for starting business in a country The government of Ethiopia is concerned that the country poor performance in doing business will discourage the flow of investment into the country and slow down growth And most importantly a poor doing business environment can impede the growth of small and medium enterprises At present Ethiopia ranks much lower than other competitor countries in the African region such as wanda Kenya zambian tanzanian and ganda To improve ethiopians investment and doing business environment the Prime Minister of ethiopian he abby Ahmed established a special Steering Committee to spearhead the reforms in all the ten indicators that are used to measure the ease of doing business The Committee started its work in December 2018 and has been meeting regularly once a month and under the chairmanship of the Prime Minister to monitor progress in the reform process and identify appropriate measures to make the business environment friendly and attractive do Improvements since 2010 Ethiopia is currently ranked with a total score of 48.0 according to the Doing Business 2020 report Topic rankings and topic scores can be summarized as per below Rankings on doing business topics to 137 ad ten 142 1 Starting Dealing Getting a with Electricity Business Construction Permits Topic Scores atm BRA 597 60.1 a a Starting a Business drank Score of starting a business Procedures number Time days Cost number pidgin mind capital of income per capital Dealing with Construction Permits drank Score of dealing with construction permits Cost of warehouse value Building quality control index Getting Electricity drank Score of getting electricity Cost of income per capital Reliability of supply and transparency of tariff index Registering Property drank Score of registering property Cost of property value Quality of the land administration index Registering Property 15.0 10.0 Getting Credit drank Score of getting credit Strength of legal rights index Depth of credit information index Credit registry coverage of adults Credit bureau coverage of adults Protecting Minority Investors drank Score of protecting minority investors Extent of disclosure index Extent of director liability index Ease of shareholder suits index Extent of shareholder rights index Extent of ownership and control index Extent of corporate transparency index Paying Taxes drank Score of paying taxes Payments number per years Time hours per years Total tax and contribution rate of profit index Summary of do reform agenda and structure Launched as a national flagship reform initiative in December 2018 by the Prime minister dry abby ahmed Framed as part of broader economic competitiveness and job creation agenda target Implement bold and deep reforms be among the top 100 ranking countries in 3 years methodology specific measurable and time bound reform action plan was developed with short medium and longterm reform measures Enforcing Resolving Contracts InsolvencyTrading across Borders drank 156 Score of trading across borders 56.0 Time to export Documentary compliance hours 76 Border compliance hours 51 Cost to export Documentary compliance 175 Border compliance 172 Documentary compliance hours 194 Border compliance hours 72 Documentary compliance 750 Border compliance 120 Enforcing Contracts drank 67 Score of enforcing contracts 62.8 Time days 530 Cost of claim value 15.2 Quality of judicial processes index 7.0 Resolving Insolvency drank 149 Score of resolving insolvency 303 Recovery rate cents on the dollars 213 Time years 3.0 Cost of estate 14.5 Outcome as piecemeal sale and 1 as going concern Strength of insolvency framework index 5.0 Institutional responsibility A National Doing Business Steering Committee chaired by the Prime Minister or his delegates was established and meets every month to monitor progress in implementation Initial success Implemented some reforms in the course of 2019 building on some reforms started earlier The way forward Continue to deeper medium terms reforms during 2020. to be implemented across 10 indicators and 9 ministries 25 do reforms implemented in the to May 2019 To achieve quick ranking improvements 8 new laws and 40 procedural and administrative reforms were enacted in 5 months These reforms focused on while laying the ground for a more ambitious medium and longterm reforms .

Investment is without doubt one of the primary engines of growth in all economies The challenge for many countries particularly economies however is how to attract quality investment in sufficient quantity ideally the most viable and sustainable option is to rely on domestic investment and the domestic private sector to and sustain the process of growth and economic development unfortunately not all countries have the savings capacity or a strong private sector that could propel a dynamic nexus Hence the need to rely on foreign savings and attract Foreign Direct Investment FDI is expected to inject into the host country not only the capital needed to initiate investment projects but also bring with it technology technical knowhow management skills and global marketing networks These elements make attracting FDI a natural point of departure for countries such as ethiopian seeking to achieve growth and implement a robust exported industrialization strategy however attracting quality FDI and retaining it is neither easy nor straightforward as is often assumed It requires among other things a favorable macro policy environment specific policies and institutions aimed at attracting investment and clearly defined laws and regulations that are transparent predictable and easy to implement The existing investment regime issued in 2012 investment Proclamation not lacks these essential features thus during Ethiopia initiated major reforms in investment laws and regulations radically changing the focus scope and level of openness of the investment regime In January the Ethiopian parliament approved the new investment proclamation marking a major shift in the country policy direction towards investment particularly foreign investment This report will briefly outline the rational for revising the existing investment laws and the implications for investment promotion What was the rationale for revising the investment legislation Modernize the legal regulatory and administrative framework of ethiopians investment regime and investment policy framework Align the investment regime with national development goals and the recent reforms in policy direction and priorities Revisit and revise the pectoral restrictions imposed on foreign investment including on Ethiopian with foreign nationalities Establish a more investment regime by moving from a positive to negative listing approach to identification of sectors and activities that are open to foreign investors Adopt best practice investment promotion facilitation and services and efficient investment administration system including and Devise a faster and more transparent investor grievance handling mechanism Align the investment regime with the country commitment under African the Continental Free Trade Area and the plans to join the World Trade Organization Inclusive and consultation approach to reforms The revision of the investment laws was conducted by a team appointed by the nice The team consisting of investment law experts policy legal practitioners and researchers was supervised by the EIC management which provided guidance and reviewed and approved key milestones in the process From the start the approach followed was transparent and based on consultations with all relevant stakeholders ok In discharging its responsibility the team used the following methodological approaches Legal analysis Review of the current and preceding investment policy proclamations regulations and identify strengths and limitations desk research on the evolution and development of investment laws in several countries to draw lesson for Ethiopia about 25 countries Empirical evidence Gathering empirical evidence and data from international organizations that have wider perspectivesoninvestmentpolicyandregulations such as the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development the World Bank the International Financial Corporation with a view to arriving at informed recommendations Consultations with government agencies Held consultations with officials from several pectoral Ministries and other public institutions Consultations with investment offices Held consultations with relevant officials from mara and gray Regional states Feedback from foreign investor associations Useful feedback was received from american eu french netherlands indian Chinese and British investor associations Survey A survey was conducted to solicit views and suggestions from investors in ethiopian both domestic and foreign Validation Workshops Several validation workshops were organized involving private investors and public sector actors Review of the draft law Written comments and feedback received from over 20 and investor associations Government commitment to enhance the role of the private sector in the economy Ethiopia has pursued a public economic development model since the reserving a proactive role for the government in many sectors of the economy Some of the more notable features of the policies applied include public investment basic infrastructure in particular transport and energy enhancing productivity in agriculture through massive investment and extension services stimulating growth through interventionist policies regulating the operations of both domestic and foreign enterprises promoting economic diversification through the Led Industrialization badly strategy and initiating bold and ambitious public sector projects These sets of policies have served Ethiopian development well over the past two decades and are the main factors for the country impressive economic growth and outstanding performance in poverty reduction ethiopian growth rate has been consistently well above the African and global average since 2003 making the country one of the fastest growing economies in the world Between 2003 and Ethiopia reduced the level of extreme poverty by half thereby meeting the internationally agreed poverty reduction goal well before the 2015 Millennium Development Goals deadline Building on these initial successes Ethiopia has embarked on the next and more demanding stage of its development process It has adopted an exported industrialization strategy anchored inthe manufacturing sector As the country implements this ambitious and challenging strategy however it may prove increasingly difficult to continue to rely on the same policy mix and source of growth that has enabled the country to achieve the recent impressive growth record The country needs to shift gear and increase the role of the private sector in the economy complementing the important function that the public sector will continue to play in building the country basic infrastructure and stability There is a growing recognition of the need for such a balancing act particularly by the new administration under the leadership of Prime Minister abby Ahmed since 2018. Since his appointment as the Prime Minister in April do abby Ahmed has emphasized the need for a balanced approach to economic development particularly the respective roles played by the private and public sectors in the economy not In a major speech at the 2019 World Economic Forum in davos the Prime Minister outlined his government s intention to open up sectors that were previously closed to foreign investment consult regularly with the private sector and create a business environment conducive for private investment He reaffirmed that the first act towards meeting these objectives would be to revise ethiopian investment laws and the regulations that govern investment activities in ethiopian In addition to reforming investment laws and rules other specific policy measures to be taken to enhance the role of the private sector in the economy include privatization A programme to privatize state owned enterprises has already been initiated The objective is to reduce public sector involvement in productive and service sectors through partial equity sales in four strategic sectors airlines telecom power and logistics and full privatization of several other does sugar plants railways industrial parks etc ya is PARTNERSHIPS A new policy commitment to increase partnership particularly in the implementation of projects already the government has plans for billion worth of infrastructure projects to be implemented through pops ok EASE OF DOING business To improve ethiopian standing in the ease of doing business ranking which measures the extent to which countries regulatory environment is conducive to business operation and protection of property rights and ACTIVE ENGAGEMENT IN REGIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL TRADE agreements Ethiopia will participate actively in regional trade negotiations and intensify the process of accession to Improvements in the new investment law Addressing the limitations of the positive list approach One of the most significant adjustments to the existing investment regime has been the shift from a positive to negative list approach when classifying sectors or economic activities that are open to foreign investors The negative list model identifies and defines exhaustively the investment areas that are fully or partially restricted to foreign investors Experience shows that most investors find this approach more transparent predictable and less confusing It also makes attracting and facilitating investment relatively easier for host countries is ANAND wanna amanda my yaw yay definition scope 1 and screening Investment definition .

larger than the other three important sources of foreign exchange income namely Overseas Development Assistance FDI and earnings from exports of goods however remittance are private sector financial flows sent to family members in Ethiopia for the purposes of supplementing household income or to finance investment in real estate Available evidence suggests that up to of remittance received by households are used for consumption purposes and to finance health care and education Harnessing remittance for purposes of investment other than consumption will require targeted policies and investment laws that make it attractive for Ethiopian to use their savings abroad for investment in productive sectors in ethiopian The new investment regime has taken steps in this direction The new investment laws allow Ethiopian including those with foreign nationality to invest in any sector without restrictions and be on a par with Ethiopian nationals In this respect the new investment laws will attract not only the members savings and investment potential but also their latent role as knowledge brokers who could facilitate the emergence of new trade patterns technology transfer skills and knowledge exchange Other Issues Addressed in the new Investment Proclamation The new investment proclamation provides clear provisions on the conditions and procedures for issuing renewing suspension and cancelation of investment permits It has also added clear provisions on investment guarantees and protection and has elaborated the rules and procedures for handling investment disputes and grievances raised by investors The new proclamation also includes several first timer provisions that have implications for investment administration For example there are new provisions on the composition and responsibilities of the Ethiopian Investment Board It also clarifies the mandate of the EIC and reinforces its role in investment promotion facilitation investment climate improvement etc finally it recognizes online systems of investment licensing and registration as essential tools for the administration of investment laws and regulations not be Key takeaways under the new investment legislation Providing legislative clarity qualified foreigners as managers supervisors trainers and other technical professionals subject to transfer of skills and knowhow to Ethiopian replacements however in the previous investment regime neither the substantive laws nor the procedures were explicit in terms of how this process is carried out in practice To ensure the required level of transparency and predictability in the system the new investment proclamation has substantially expanded the specific provisions dealing with expat employment The new proclamation clarifies the rights and obligations of foreign investors detailing the procedures that apply and specifying the respective roles of line ministries in delivering the services In ethiopian investors are permitted to employ foreigners in top management positions without adhering to conditions or restrictions that apply to other expats however unfortunately the previous investment proclamation did not distinguish between the different top management positions for example Chief Executive officer Chief Operations Officer Chief Finance Officer etc To remedy this ambiguity the new investment legislation have included an indicative list showing the types of positions that are considered as top management in the context of the Ethiopian investment regime provision of work permit related services Under the previous investment laws pics One Stop Shop facility offered work permit related services covering issuance renewal replacement suspension and cancellation of foreign employee work permits but this had limited timeframe the service was extended only until the investor obtains the business license or basically enters into project implementation phase This led to unnecessary division of work streams between the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs and the EIC causing difficulty in the effective delivery of services to investors In recognition of this problem the new investment laws have streamlined the process to enable investors to receive services at the One Stop Shop of the nice The Commission shall provide work permits at any stage of the investment cycle

Since the introduction of the programmed the Young Professionals gypsy have become an integral part of nice contributing and delivering on core areas such as investment promotion facilitation

skills and experience The presence of yes in the EIC has injected new dynamism and skills particularly in the application of new technologies and software for improving the services provided by the commission The fact that the EIC is now able to handle an increasing number of investors and their demands in a timely manner is attributed to the contributions made by the yes obviously there are lessons for other institutions from this innovative scheme for tackling the constraints to effective implementation and delivery of 43 je na do The Objectives of Jobs Compact Programme According to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees in the number of refugees in the world had reached nearly 69 million It is estimated that about 85 percent of them are hosted by other developing countries that are themselves and still at an early stage of development One of these host countries is ethiopian which is home to over a million refugees the largest number of refugees than any other African countries Some of the refugees have resided in Ethiopia for more than a decade without immediate prospect of returning home or moving on to other destinations To ensure that the refugees enjoy a productive and dignified life while staying in ethiopian the government has established a special programme Jobs Compact Programme to explore ways in which refugees and Ethiopians seeking employment could obtain decent jobs and engage in economic activities that supports their livelihood The jap is supported by development partners and coordinated by the nice which also serves as implementing agency working closely with other public institutions most notably the Administration for Refugees and Returnees Affairs the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs and the Industrial Parks Development Corporation Key components of the programme include Creating economic opportunities for Ethiopians and Refugees who reside in ethiopian The support offered includes providing the legal basis for refugees to take up employment opportunities The programme also provides additional support in housing skills development matching and oversight to ensure that refugees and Ethiopians rights and wellbeing are upheld Improving the broader investment climate The Government has prioritized significant investments in transport logistics and power to help crowding private investment In addition a One Stop Shop boss service labour units in industrial parks have been introduced along with a Client Charter on the turnaround and investor registration processes Strengthening investment promotion capability is another important support provided by the programmed EL Improving labor productivity and quality of jobs An important component of the programme is improving worker skills and reducing levels of absenteeism and turnover Much of the Ethiopian labour force is new to both the formal sector and work and the transition will need carefully targeted policies that improve labour sourcing grading and the provision of soft and technical skills training It also includes creating good working conditions and providing adequate social infrastructure for workers in industrial parks Fulfilling these conditions will improve labour productivity Enhancing the sustainability of existing industrial parks ethiopians reputation for sustainable and inclusive development is both an important end by itself and a prominent part of the brand for investment promotion The commitment to carbon neutral growth zero liquid discharge facilities at the harass industrial park and other investments have played an important part in reinforcing the parks sustainability Future activities will include seeking innovative approaches to rainfall capture and solar power generation and adherence to global best practice in social compliance in both industrial park construction and protection of the workforce in the textile sector predominately female 15 4 tourism Time to reveal the hidden potential of 5. tourism Time to reveal the latent potential of Ethiopia Over the last two years the Government of Ethiopia has taken bold steps to promote the tourism sector as a priority area and transform Ethiopia into one of the preferred tourist destinations in african Tourism forms one of the priority sectors identified for economic competitiveness and job creation under the homegrown economic reform agenda and the ten year perspective plan In June Ethiopia launched an visa regime allowing travelers to process visa requirements online In November the Government decided to extend a visa on arrival regime for almost all African travelers making it possible for African travelers to have easy mobility and stopover in ethiopian This has moved ethiopians ranking in the adds Africa Visa Openness Index from with in 2018 to with in 2019. In August Ethiopia launched two new strategies for the development of Stopover and Meetings Incentives Conferences and Exhibitions mice tourism The strategies aim to place Ethiopia among the most competitive destinations on Stopover and MICE tourism leveraging the various assets the country already has including its globally leading national airline Ethiopian Airlines as well as adds abbas strategic hub position not only in but also as a diplomatic and political hub In October Ethiopia inaugurated and opened for visitors Unity Park which is located in ethiopians National Grand palace The Park has various attractions including historical buildings indigenous plants exhibition indigenous black mane lion zoo a green area regions pavilion and over 1000 displayed items The concerted reform efforts taken by the Government of Ethiopia has been fully recognized in global platforms with increased attention being given to the country by the international media and global awards coming into ethiopian the The visa platform AR can be accessed by scanning this do visa 7 ETHIOPIA The Ethiopia Visa is an electronic travel authorization which allows visitors to enter the country It is available to citizens of all countries and it has eliminated the need to physically go to an embassy or consulate or queue at the border for a visa The application is completed online and only takes a matter of minutes What is the Ethiopian visa The Ethiopian Online Visa was launched to accelerate the process of obtaining a visa for ethiopian Citizens from all countries can quickly complete the online application form by answering a series of basic questions Applications are normally processed within 24 hours though on rare occasions the process can take up to three days Once approved the Visa is sent to the applicant by email Travelers can present their visa along with their passport to the Ethiopian border authorities at addis ababa hole International Airport to gain entry The electronic visa for Ethiopia is a visa and applicants have the choice of either a or visa Who needs a visa for ethiopian The vast majority of travelers need a visa for Ethiopia to be able to enter Citizens of Kenya can enter without a visitor periods of up to a year and citizens of can enter for a period of up to three months These are the only two nationalities The Ethiopia visa has effectively eliminated the need to queue at the border for a visa on arrival as the application can be completed in advanced The visa is available to eligible from every country 49 A brief summary of pectoral studies conducted by the EIC 6. A brief summary of pectoral studies conducted by the EIC The pharma industry The annual pharmaceutical market in Ethiopia is estimated to be worth just 500 million and growing at a rate of per annum however Ethiopia is still highly dependent on imports for the supply of pharmaceutical products Local manufacturers have limited production capabilities and the product ranges produced locally is narrow It is estimated for example that local producers supply only 90 of more than 380 products that are on the national list of essential medicines The lack of domestic productive capacity limits the availability of affordable and easily accessible medicines to ethiopians growing population of more than Ethiopia has also a growing domestic medical devices market composed of medical supplies and equipment with imports expected to grow to million or about of the total demand for medical devices The government through the Ethiopian Pharmaceutical Supply Agency is the largest customers representing of the total market The Tony Blair Institute for Global Change has supported the EIC and other agencies in conducting analytical studies to assess the potential for manufacturing medical supplies and in ethiopian current opportunities and challenges and the reforms required to improve the sector particularly in attracting FDI and developing the capabilities for import substitution and eventually exports The rationale for conducting a study on the medical supplies and are The rapid increase in health coverage in Ethiopia led by massive public investment in the health sector to meet the increasing demand for health care services by a growing population In there were health posts across the country and additional 438 were under construction There were also health centres and 68 were under construction The number of hospitals in the country 381 and additional 218 were under construction Most of the facilities under construction at that time are now finished and operational predictably the rapid increase in health care facilities including at referral hospital level has generated a growing demand for medical supplies and equipment not The choice for the government is to either continue to rely on imports to meet the growing demand for medical supplies or set in motion the policies and incentives required to encourage investment in import substitution of medical supplies and instruments The government has identified the pharmaceutical sector in general as a priority area for import substitution and the study by fbi contributes towards that objective by assessing the feasibility for producing medical supplies and instruments in ethiopian Ethiopia does not have a strategy on medical devices and per see however the Government has put forward an ambitiousnationalhealthsectortransformation plan and a strategy for the development of the pharmaceutical industry Achieving both these objectives will require steady progress in the country domestic capability to produce medical devices and instruments apparatus In this respect the study on medical devices has been extremely helpful in mapping what the government needs to do to boost domestic capacity for manufacturing of medical devices and instruments For example the study has identified the fiscal and incentives required to encourage investment in import substitution of medical devices The recommendations are now being considered by the Ministry of finance which is responsible for reviewing the country incentive system similarly other recommendations covering areas such as the improvement of skills strengthening regulatory and certification procedures and investment financing options are also under consideration Some of these measures will enable the country to acquire the capability to meet the Good Manufacturing Practice certification requirements which is essential if Ethiopia is to develop a medical devices manufacturing capacity that meets international standards The sector the nice in collaboration with the Ethiopian Agricultural Transformation Agency initiated a study on the Food and Beverage Processing and Auxiliary Industries The main objectives of the study were twofold to assess the level of development of the Food and Beverage Processing and supporting industries in ethiopian and to develop a strategy for attracting investment into the industry including the development of effective domestic supply chain Although the Food and Beverage industry has been growing consistently over the past decades its contribution to the country gap remains small At present the industry accounts for only 2 percent of gap however domestic demand for processed food products has been growing fast in recent years outpacing the capacity of the local industries to meet local demand This has forced the country to increasingly rely on imports In the total cost of imported processed food and beverages accounted for us 465 million The fbi study focuses in two areas landscape analysis and analysis The landscape analysis evaluates the current landscape of the Food Beverage Processing Industry focusing on the and policies regulations including an assessment of the existing challenges and providing recommendations for enhancing the capacity of local industries The analysis focuses on a rigorous and phased process and identified five value chains namely Red meat poultry Edible oil wheat and Fruit juice Deep dives were developed for each value chain that assessed the market opportunities challenges across the value chain and improvement areas The strategy has identified over 5.25 million Ha of land to provide opportunities for the development of selected commodities in the value chains In short the strategy that the EIC and ATA developed has multiple objectives to identify key opportunities and recommend on how to attract investment and transform the value chains in food processing and beverages develop local capacity to meet domestic demand for processed foods and beverages and make Ethiopia competitive in the export market by learning from best practices in other countries leveraging existing natural resources creating enabling policy and institutional environment and implementing the recommended interventions across value chains Fruit juice Although Ethiopia is the ith largest producer of fruits in the African continent it does not have price competitiveness in fruit juice and concentrate production The strategy recommends a approach Phase promoting local processing capacity importing pulp and concentrate and increasing fruit production yield and volume This will be followed by Phase processing with a view to gradually discontinuing import of pulp and concentrate for processing and making Ethiopia competitive in the export market Red meat Ethiopia has the and largest population of livestock in the continent ranking ith globally yet has relatively low exports of red meat Ethiopia is currently unable to compete in the international market due to high cost of production The new strategy recommends commercial ranching to ensure consistent supply of livestock reduce the involvement of middlemen in marketing and introduce regulations and standards that will upgrade ethiopians competitiveness in international markets wheat Ethiopia currently imports about 19 percent of the national wheat consumed in the country which accounts for 36 percent of local demand for processed wheat This requires large amounts of foreign currency which the lacks because of slow growth in exports Reliance on imports also distorts local prices and can create supply shortages when foreign exchange in short supply In line with the Government of ethiopians goal of making the country wheat by the strategy proposes an additional ha of land to be allocated for production of wheat either in the lowlands or through salinity improvement in the highlands In addition large scale processors are needed to meet the demand gap in existing final goods processing poultry Ethiopia is far behind in utilizing its abundant chicken resources efficiently The country has the potential to become competitive in the global market due to its low processing and operational costs if limitations in feed and cost of docs are addressed The strategy proposes a two phase approach Phase import substitution and Phase exporting to international markets based on meeting quality and standard requirements Edible oils Ethiopia has abundant resources suitable for oiled production but due to limited edible oil production capacity over of local demand is met through imports mainly palm oil Ethiopia can become competitive in edible oil by addressing challenges in raw material sourcing packaging and processing efficiency To achieve this a strategic direction has been recommended Phase enhancing local primary and secondary processing capacity through import of crude palm and soft oils while increasing local production of and end tend local processing and Phase increasing local processing capability and efficiency and becoming over time a net exporter of edible oils Auxiliary industry to ensure the success of the food and beverage processing industry it is imperative to develop the local capacity of the auxiliary industries that support the sector To this end cold chain transportation packaging and storage were identified to be the most critical challenges across value chains Addressing the bottlenecks in these three auxiliary industries will greatly enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the supply chain in the industry The recommendation to allow FDI in cold chain business has been endorsed by parliament as part of the recently new investment laws It is hoped that this policy adjustment will help boost investment into one of the important value chains in the industry 55 The Oxford Handbook of Industrial Hubs and Economic Development rebe quay and Justin yiu line Oxford University press May 2020 pages isn Inthe decades Ethiopia has pursued an exported industrialization strategy anchored in the manufacturing sector and supported by a new generation of sustainable industrial parks as part of the strategy globally industrialization supported by industrial hubs has been widely associated with structural transformation and There are about industrial hubs special economic zones export processing zones industrial parks technology parks etc spread across 147 countries with a high concentration in developing and emerging economies particularly in asian While the economic benefits such as exports employment and revenues from taxes of industrial hubs are important their value lies first and foremost in their role as incubators of manufacturing firms and technological capability building The appeal of industrial hubs as instruments of exported industrialization is likely to grow in african The success of a few countries such as ethiopian in using industrial parks as springboard for participation in Global Value Chains has generated heightened interest and curiosity on industrial hubs as instruments of investment and industrial policy It is important therefore to have a thorough and comprehensive understanding of industrial hubs and their impact on economic development particularly the implications for job creation attracting investment building export capacity technology transfer gender equality sustainable development and boosting domestic productive capacity through linkages All these issues are addressed in a forthcoming Handbook on Industrial Hubs edited by do rebe quay and Professor Justin Lin and to be published by Oxford university press The Oxford Handbook of Industrial Hubs and Economic Development is a volume that applies an approach to examine the conceptual underpinnings and operational imperatives of industrial hubs The Handbook reviews empirical evidence from different regions and economies and extracts pertinent lessons for both and researchers It illustrates the diverse and complex nature of industrial hubs and shows how they promote industrialization economic structural transformation and technological The Handbook also explores the interface between industrial hubs and emerging issues and trends such as environmental protection and sustainability technological advancement the shifts in the global economy and urbanization The concluding chapter emphasizes the mentality of learning and latecomer advantages The main objectives of the Handbook are to examine the conceptual underpinnings and research associated with industrial hubs and economic development to extract from empirical evidence relevant policy lessons for researchers and practitioners and to provide alternative perspectives and approaches on industrial hubs embedded in an industrial policy framework and linked to the process of structural transformation and technological The Handbook includes over fifty chapters written by eminent scholars and researchers with an knowledge of the role impact and the strength and weaknesses of industrial hubs Their contribution provides conceptual clarity on the term industrial hub which is a generic term often used to describe a variety of specially designated sites that countries establish to incubate manufacturing enterprises such as industrial parks special economic zones industrial districts zones and technology parks The Handbook is organized under seven themes theories and context and historical perspective gender and environmental sustainability policy and practices in asian Latin american and African economies and future pathways Authors bio rebe pod is a Senior Minister and
