Creating New Productive Capacity for the Leather Industry National Leather Roadmap november 2018 medic Acknowledgement This Strategy was commissioned by the Ministry of Trade and Industry motif and Ethiopian Investment Commission in coordination with the Ethiopian Leather Industry Development Institute We wish to thank various institutions for their valuable contribution to this documents Ethiopian Leather Industry Association for their valuable comments and technical support Enterprise Partners kept for their help in facilitating and providing useful and constructive recommendations on this project Special thanks goes to the Department of International Development for financing this project six Data Usage Disclaimer The data on this publication should not be regarded as complete data is from It is the readers responsibility to check that the data is accurate and applies to the current situation of the leather industry Creating New Productive Capacity for the Leather Industry Contents 1. Executive Summary Executive Summary The leather sector is one of the priority sectors identified by the government strictly following the value addition policy that the government has put in place for the manufacturing sector as a whole Following the various value addition policy changes over the years the sectors competitiveness has experienced variable growth and decline periods culminating in export value earnings not reaching targets Such significant policy changes require time for the industry as a whole to fully adopt and adapt to from all facets of the leather business and its value chain consequently the poor export performance has necessitated in relevant government bodies nice in partnership with Enterprise Partners to agree to explore the leather sector with a view to understanding its current global market position and the challenges it currently faces ultimately generating recommendations for bold measures towards improving its competitiveness and overall performance It is essential to understand and embrace the sectors performance against the evolving drivers dictated by the global leather market Of particular note is an increased impetus relating to environmental aspects addressing the scope of sustainability and understanding modern social compliance pressures accordingly the sector must look to significantly advanced becoming more efficient and embracing environmental based criteria Leather chemical manufacturers are a major source of assistance and continue to develop cleaner technologies that tackle environmental pressures Ethiopian manufacturers in general have not evolved nor fully understood the increased quality assurance and compliance requirements of the global market The government has opened up the sector to foreign investment starting which has attracted more than fifteen FDI yet only four footwear manufacturing factories The challenges faced are at both the and micro level essentially factory level including severe shortages of accessible foreign currency continued raw material quality deterioration weak modern production management systems and the absence of an efficiently functioning ecosystem input supply market logistics workforce development etc If captured correctly there is an immense opportunity that the Ethiopian leather sector can tap into with key points noted Shift sectors positioning in the global market through better understanding of global requirements and customer needs Target and improve raw material quality and availability recognizing it is an essential primary input Advance and streamline processes and operations to realize overall improved profitability and efficiency Embrace and adopt environmental sustainability and social standards that are desired by export markets Attract and incentivize good quality dis whom are focused on final product manufacturing to further develop the entire leather value chain Overhaul support institutions to ensure they offer genuine mealtime knowledge and assistance to the industry as a whole The reality is simply that to implement all of these changes shall require commitment investment and an for business to be forged within with said ecosystem functioning to create positive and progressive interactions that both encourage and facilitate manufacturing coordination structure and collaboration is critical in order to deliver on the set of recommendations proposed in this roadmap where improvements need to be addressed and introduced by all stakeholders within the industry The value chain is only as strong as its weakest link and issues can ultimately wreak havoc causing lost profitability and revenue generation benchmark countries have put in place the required attributes required to supply the global market and these efforts are yielding true business value to all stakeholders But they are also constantly evolving and adapting to the landscape of trade around the globe Business sectors must not view this as a challenge but more of an opportunity for success It is apparent that bold and drastic reforms are required to incentivize and reboot the industry it is extremely important to be mindful that industries need time to adapt to significant changes and requirements needed to position itself correctly and with confidence in the global market consequently such changes introduced require adequate time to become fully effective and in order to sustain the gain they will bring building a reliable and robust business platform ca pay yn Thom we convene is Lira .

America brazil and argentina are known to supply both and finished leather Cheap labor and resources Tanning capabilities Strength of supply chain ease of logistics Final product manufacturers Shifts in raw material sourcing will drive movement and relocation of finished goods manufacturers Asian countries who once offered cost advantages are becoming increasingly expensive indicating a search for

Ethiopia had a slightly stronger growth rate at On the other hand the growth rate of sheep and goat leather is negative whereas ethiopians production grew by in the same five year period This is in line with its current strength Although most of the value chain activities currently take place in developing countries numerous challenges have to be addressed and managed carefully Key challenges for emerging manufacturing hubs like Ethiopia Outdated Production Technologies Shortage of Experienced Professionals Limited Resources Challenges Supply Low level Chain and Technical and Relationship . Physical Issues Barriers Infrastructure Poor information for technology Cultural application Organizational Dependency on Imported inputs are increasingly addressed through global shifts in supply chain management Current trends indicate a pressing need for developing countries to become a part of larger supply chain models in order to contribute to and increase competitiveness and resulting customer satisfaction increased economic development has resulted in increased disposable income and discerning customers providing augmented market opportunities for manufacturers integration in global value chain leads to upgrade in manufacturing technology and capabilities to boost the leather sectors and allow entry into more complex products Partnerships with leading countries brands also leads to overhaul of entire or parts of value chain to make available better quality and increasingly differentiated final products however there is a genuine need to manage the mode of insertion into the global economy concerning the capability of integration in to export markets in a manner which would provide for sustainable income growth source Internal analysis expert knowledge and resources As the industry continues to evolved manufacturers and suppliers are gaining tighter supply chain control and placing emphasis on sustainable production systems Rigorous control of supply chain Tight control of supply chain by large retailers to aggressively cut costs remove intermediaries and respond desi nol desi rapidly to customer requirements Improved design technology and custom design Greater control on product margins Significant innovation increased focus on anatomy of foot and movement Visible shift from approach to customers central approach Large brands have influenced creation of low cost sports shoes of which Ethiopia is a large importer Increase in training centers by buyers Huge range of customer segments has led European countries to set up training centers to preserve and further develop specific skills such as high end shoe making emerge no Strong and creative use of media to build presence marketing in order to develop both Trends physical and virtual marketing channels to capture larger part of fragmented customer base Focus increasingly seen on creating more involved and direct customer experience Manufacturers focusing on development of flexible supply chains allowing use of wider range of suppliers Shortage of workers and rising labor costs in China driving manufacturers to alternative sources in Asia and outlook Analytics to build sustainability Improvements in production techniques in order to best use limited resources Reduction in environmental impact also translates to increased access to global players Ethiopia has opportunity early on to promote greener economy outlook In the coming 5 years industry is expected to experience reduction in raw material production and movement in the finished products manufacturing 5 year outlook on rest finished leather leather should alert players in the Ethiopian leather industry to the following rest countries will continue to produce res as a byproduct to the meat industry The meat industry is expected to experience a dip as vegans increase in influence as well as implications remnants factor the to reduce methane emissions For example Independent researchers in the UK are suggesting such ideas as two days in a week meatless days meat taxes and that people become Implications on competing effectively Finished leather will continue to face challenges from the generation on sustainability Quality and price pressure environmental and social responsibility Synthetics will continue to compete with leather even though synthetics are facing environmental and sustainability Shift on product types Leather products brands and customers will continue to demand better cheaper and faster Shift in sourcing productions with a big skew on environmental social and sustainability aspects . Other African countries working on improving investment and business climate for the leather Manufacturing chasing cheaper due to the huge cost drive up in china sector investors are looking to relocate The world of consumers is changing and Ethiopian businesses need to acknowledge this Key Declining trend of leather use in footwear and Leather use of automotive is suggested to have stagnated very recently due to concerns from the younger generation however the trend had been growing for automotive used Demand for chrome free and metal free tanned leather is expected to grow from brands it is an emerging technology that will generate leather from sources The scope of this engagement was to study and benchmark international experiences and implications for Ethiopia based on the gaps assessed in the Ethiopian leather sector Key objectives Scope of case study 1.

price of chemical supplied through bonded warehouse is higher than products which are directly imported Factories seeking to use voucher system to gain benefits are unable to do so because of lengthy time Repeated search by customs authority as well as shortage of inspectors can lead up to 1 week to sell a product to a user Long period of time taken to release chemicals despite the repeated use in

addition Sector structure and Positioning Production Process Marketing Input supplies Functions Both pull and approach needs to be applied to the Ethiopian leather sector thus creating an integrated value chain as well as the need to focus on its resource base Specific Constraint Not enough final product manufacturing taking place in the country which brings significantly more value and employment Poor and declining raw material it is a resource based sector for Ethiopia to capitalize on Context Ethiopia was not able to build strong and large leather product manufacturers It also has a declining raw material quality that is also not getting demand in the global market when transformed by local While the amount of investment that is needed to transform leather from raw to finished is significant in comparison from raw to the major financial gain comes from transforming finished leather to final product Details of Recommendation Consider the release of product to the global market blow grade Invest heavily in getting the product manufacturing base bring the entire value chain within the country moth Countries like India banned leather export however has succeeded in creating product manufacturing industry Indonesia also has a ban on exporting material and ensures it is consumed within by product manufacturers for global brands italian manufacturers specializes within clusters Brazil supplies all levels of leather as well as products to the global market Input supplies Production Process Marketing Restructure the sector and redefine its position in the global leather value chain DO NOT RESTRICT incentivize Weak competitiveness of the sector internationally weak positioning Low grade materials not being utilized or are within the country including FDI product Local actors dying out risk of dominance by foreign actors manufacturers Not enough product manufacturers to utilize existing leather produced The sector hasn t seen a significant gain from the value addition policy change Leather sector and its respective markets are complex and have their own different competitiveness aspects dominated by leather product type to be generated To ask manufacturers to be specialized along the value chain since it is complex and requires huge amount of investment As an example the cost complexity and capital investment of machinery to transform res into a finished leather is typically far more than if only processing from res through to pickled and this is exacerbated if low grade material requires major upgrading technology to be employed The core of the current policy is beneficial as it fuels the products market in ethiopian however two of the major dis supply themselves from their own tannery At the moment there is not enough product manufacturers to consume the finished leather that is being produced by the existing For the tanner s to go out and look for finished leather buyers has proved to be a daunting task and not a successful one Strategic risk to the country if the leather actors are only going to be felis Put mechanisms in place for exporting low grade materials in state as it will be better to at Ensure that the locally owned tanning industry remains ensuring the future least gain costs for such material rather than it become a burden and ultimately a financial loss proofing of res transformation processing of Ethiopian material Put incentives to attract product manufacturing in country to absorb local tannery leather production Allow tanner s to decide how to segment the transformation process which could provide more focused and specialized production Ownership Benchmark moth Some of the Italian manufacturers specialize within the leather producing clusters Brazil has one of the most successful leather industry with their actors doing both finished leather as well as final Many tanners in other countries cream off the better material for themselves and sell the lower grades to other tanners around the world Production Process Input supplies Marketing Drive real value addition from final product manufacturing not only from finished leather Value addition policy is not actually creating value Pricing of leather exported seems to be varied and have a relatively low selling price Weak market access to finished leather due to weak relationships and quality price command Both and finished leather are inputs to the leather sector in its entirety The historical rule of thumb in the leather sector for type finished leather is that raw material counts for 50 of the total finished leather price This leaves 40 for the value addition and the profit margin but this must be balanced with actual selling price related to cutting yields if the quality is poor To command a good quality finished leather requires more machinery talent and market access To transform from to finished leather requires intensive work for the value it will be bringing It costs more to upgrade low grade materials at it stands now there is no capacity to invest on the low quality Leaves us with two options either find a market for it at a sensible price or find an alternative market in other sectors pharma and industry which will take the raw material simply as collagen To be able to complete the entire product manufacturing in ethiopian will be fuelling the economy from all the additional activities and employment that product manufacturing will be creating This will require the finished leather supply to improve its quality and increase volume for which further technical improvements need to take effect Strategically multiple product manufacturers to relocate to ethiopian Instead of targeting existing manufacturers Putin place a mechanism by which good reliable and consistent finishing perhaps deliver the opportunity message direct to brands This would require Western support to sell the possibility in the country is communal upgrading facility could Bring in other types of investment we go those looking to source collagen basing it off of the use of the byproduct of the be created that specializes only in upgrading techniques and production leather sector in the country moth A number of countries such as indonesian indian etc have employed incentives to ensure that final product manufacturing is completed lid in their country that is aligned to ensuring the use of domestically sourced res Companies such as devon have collagen refining facilities located around the globe to access various res waste Less gain Ethiopia is exporting more than of its finished leather at less Less value addition by tanner s hence commanding low price than us Only of ethiopians exports brought a price of and above The low export price performance is despite the country value addition policy that is aimed at increasing export earnings from exporting value added products The restrictive tax policy was also introduced to achieve the same results The government needs to closely follow the export performance of this sector and ensure that the country is getting its fair share from the finished products it is shipping thus ensuring the export products are in no way being undervalued It is also important and timely to understand the reasons behind the continuous low export price performance accounting for a significant share of the export volume Although it is known that price points are different for different finished leather types buyers mostly in ethiopians case level of value addition and finish selection determine the final negotiated price Ensure the minimum cost of production is covered by the claimed price Ensure the right price is being fetched from the raw material used Suggest price target ranges for different finished leather categories this should generate an additional 7 to 10 million dollars moth India typically consumes leather produced internally and imports as necessary lid Recommendations focusing on inputs supply chemical Accessories etc ring we in Year 2 Year 3 Year 4 Year 5 I Introduce floor price mechanism for res at production and collection level to incentivize better collection rate Improve res management and inspection system Policy recommend ions Develop an Ethiopian Restricted Substance List in line with 1 leg base recommendations for chemicals Enable existing FDI footwear factories to import accessories and components and supply in the domestic market In the long run promote new investment in accessories Technical recommendation Improve the bonded warehouse system Production Marketing Introduce floor price mechanism for res at production and collection level to incentivize better collection rate Discouraging prices observed in the first level markets leading to lower collection rate overall in turn causing lower supply to the Disagreement on grade and origin of res supplied Currently there is a serious scenario occurring driven primarily through availability and perceived quality of the rest Such highs and lows of pricing and availability which originate at the res stage serve no benefit to the tanners whom are unable to pass on regular fluctuating costs in the final leather cost As such it creates issues where tanners effectively gamble upon raw material inventory which can cause extreme pressure on or potentially having to overpriced the final leather as forward cover for high res prices impacting on sales opportunities If a tanner has no raw material they have nothing to make leather with In addition it is also known that fbi s are paying higher prices in order to access better quality or larger skins and thus their purchasing power is causing an imbalance that is effectively penalizing the local Through introduction of a more regulated floor price the res sector is incentivized to increase collection rates and a standardised price will smooth the sale price to tanner s and ensure greater volume related opportunity for the country as a whole A floor price mechanism will also incentivize small holder farmers and small traders to seriously consider improved handling of rest Small traders will actively become involved in collection of rest ultimately increasing the supply of res as opposed to wastage moth Ownership Improve res management and inspection system Poor management of res leading to deteriorating grade and quality The loss of quality can be directly related in to a financial value Even with crude estimates it is anticipated that over is lost in export revenue due to quality related issues whether it be reject skins or just simply large cutting yield losses postmortem defects can be addressed in the short run which will increase the grade selection while antemortem defects require long term animal husbandry interventions Hides and skins extension and regulatory service needs to reinforced led by Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock resources It needs to carry out regular res improvement activity such as capacity building and training program for res traders artisans and butchers provision of inputs such as field vehicles res preparation equipment etc and employing res technicians and experts working all over the country This process will support the increased capability of small holder farmers res small traders and large scale traders to improve the management of res leading to quality improvement Standard Operating Procedure sop to be introduced at the abattoir level abattoir should be utilising best practices to ensure the res is treated as a valuable byproduct As such an instructional SOP can be generated to provide sufficient training and quality control checks during the process in order to yield improved rest A quarterly inspection led be technicians to be conducted to ensure if the SOP is being implemented or not If not implemented then the licence of the abattoir to be revoked molar in the annual slaughter volume in Brazil has reached 60 million head of cattle including establishments of registration system lid with the Federal Inspection Service the State Inspection Service sie and the Municipal Inspection Service The inspection system

noncompliance Failure to conform to global standards leading to loss of market share and poor reputation as a manufacturing base rel plays a critical role in ensuring export products meet chemical compliance programs from the brands and export markets Responsible chemical management goes beyond complying with test limits or finished materials Best practices for chemical management begin with controlling the quality of chemicals sourced and used within a manufacturing facility By using industry tools that guide procurement of compliant input chemistry suppliers can confidently select chemical formulations that enable improved worker safety in addition to wastewater material and product compliance that will meet the criteria of export markets and brands Failure to comply could mean loss of business or worse still product recalls which are extremely expensive scenarios lid to develop an Ethiopian Restricted Substance List in line with leg base recommendations The list will be

coordinate the rel testing process in collaboration with a reputable laboratory abroad go sara internet laboratories worldwide etc to ensure that imported chemicals are in line with the roll If the chemicals are not in conformation to the roll the source will be identified and punitive action will be take such as licence revoke of the importer etc lid ass have been gaining importance over the last 20 years and it is commonplace for tanners in other countries or those suppliers to large brands to adhere to their rel guidelines in order to be able to supply to the brands Taking it further certain chemical companies are now offering must chemical inputs which are and thus ensure that they contain no products on the rel lists go stable Enable existing FDI footwear factories to supply the domestic market with accessories and components and provide product development services In the long run promote new investment in accessories Delayed delivery time of products due to long lead time needed to secure accessories and components Very small scale industry in ethiopian currently there is no business case for new investment due to manufacturing industry not being large enough The leather product manufacturers especially the domestic ones are constrained by timely supply of accessories and components also they suffer from fore shortage which compounds the complexity As a results the factories are not able to meet export orders in time alternately the dis have automatically fore available and can import in a timely fashion therefore there is a potential opportunity for synergy between the dis and domestic factories where the dis supply accessories to the domestic factories which benefit the Enable existing FDI footwear factories to supply the domestic market with accessories and components The dis have enough fore and working capital to import and manufacture accessories and components surplus to their own consumption If they have clear purchase orders from the domestic factories they can import on behalf of them and sell in local currency This will guarantee supply of quality accessories in a timely manner also ensuring high quality of inputs which otherwise would be imported from substandard sources and with longer lead times Develop a clear financial transaction mechanism for dis to offer this facility Once there is enough volume business for accessories and components new investment in leather product factories Ethiopian investment commission should promote and incentivize new dis or domestic investors to manufacture accessories This is a common practice in the Indian and garments industry where dis sell their additional accessories to the moth immediate engagement with felis to establish a domestic factories which enables a scenario and collaboration amongst the domestic industry and fish scheme for the input supply to take place EIC crafting incentives packages for dis to engage in this additional activity optimism utilization of existing abattoir and encouraging farms and abattoir via new investment following the directive already approved by the Ethiopian investment board Absence of commercial farms consistently supplying for the meat and also leather industry Collection rates vary revolving around three peak seasons hoard supply to benefit from high prices in low seasons Poor slaughtering practices leading to poor quality res supply Leather is a byproduct of the meat industry and predominantly relies on good quality raw material to attain export markets Currently the farming of the bovine sheep and goat in the country is dispersed in turn affecting quality and consistency in supply Promote new investment in commercial farming and abattoir Land should be identified in areas where predominantly there are more animals per so my Opportunities of significantly improving quality are available not only in the rest but also the meat and milk as well through modern techniques of husbandry vaccination favourable grazing environment less chance of scratch type defects better feed etc apply therefore the investment pitch should consider a comprehensive approach of meat dairy and leather industry This approach poses an opportunity to target investors from the who are interested in investing in the meat industry This recommendation also poses an opportunity to establish full system which in turn would attract more export market and brands Introduce better feed supply than can be found naturally as the structure of the is not only genetic but closely associated with dietary Benchmark Countries such as usa uk Brazil have commercial farms that raise herds or flocks of animals primarily for the meat and dairy industries They also understand the value of the res and work towards reducing antemortem defects As such husbandry practices are in place along with fully regulated abattoir with strict cops and legislation High levels of training and quality based schemes to avoid perimortem defects In addition the res is immediately placed in molar and EIC conducive storage conditions to avoid postmortem defects Develop process or pickling plant by abattoir traders or tanners Storing of res is a challenge as the supply is highly seasonal Disagreement on grade between the res traders and tanner due to transacting at raw stage Quality of res deteriorate due to challenging transportation system and poor storing res material should be either fully cured or processed as quickly as possible after it is removed from the animal Typical curing systems involve large amounts of salt which is an issue to the environment and can be difficult to treat at the effluent stage An option is to develop a capability for almost immediate processing to occur on the rest taking the material through to a processing stage that is safe for the res to be held for extended periods of time without fear of putrefaction This provides opportunity to be able to genuinely grade the res typically if sold in the raw state it is virtually impossible to detect grain defects which is a primary driver of the ultimate value of the Another aspect to consider is that by creating a pickling plant or metal free preplanned leather it can create opportunity to generate chrome free or metal free leathers which are gaining traction in the marketplace although it is vitally important to understand that within the leg audit scoring system if Chrome free leathers are generated from pickle they will obtain a score the same as if it were chrome tanned whereas a chrome free leather made without going to the pickle stage will generate a positive scoring Thus to satisfy the export market either leather or final products Ethiopia should not gear up to be effectively only chrome tanned leather and this system allows this possibility Develop pickling plant onsite at a the cept where there are number of abattoir close by alternatively this could be a joint venture or collaborative approach between local traders and specific Process and new techniques need to be developed within the traders and tanner s to implement the idea The capacity building initiative could be managed by lid and international consultants The process enables traders to store the res for longer period transport safely without the fear of putrefaction and finally allows traders and tanner s to properly grade the rest This would enable greater transparency consistency and trust amongst the trading stakeholders leading unto introduction of contract trading morality which will induce further quality improvement of res in the value chain lid with Development partners USA whilst not exactly the same they do supply predominantly a tanned material for further processing typically immediately processed from the abattoir This allows material to be supplied that can be effectively graded and sorted for the resulting final article and thus the tanner purchases only what is required The proposal above is a slight spin on this industry standard New Zealand has a very large wool sheepskin sector and the skins are typically traded in the pickle stage again as this is a stage where the material can be safely stored and much more accurate quality grading can be achieved along with size and to a degree of thickness Focusing on animal health and handling Poor animal health practices leading to deteriorating grade and quality of rest Poor animal transportation issues are predominant rand marks scars scratches fighting or more significantly from parasitic or sect top 3 he is particularly on skin and hide for causing grain defects similar to cockle witnessed in UK and New zealand which can seriously downgrade skin quality Parasitic we go biting lice kids etc damage far outweighs the other antemortem issues with suggestions of quality related issues attributed to this in particular the eke defect and as such there is a significant loss to the tanner as the parasitic issue is only visualise once at the pickle or wet tanned state This ultimately means a loss on three aspects being the initial purchase of the defective skin secondly the cost of processing such poor quality material and finally the loss of potential profit due to the skin not being fit for the export type market Extend national animal health programs with support of continuous public fund and permanent staffing and structure This would enable significant and much needed resource and support to address the animal health issue in a systemic way Some technical steps can be taken to improve the quality of res such as alternatives to branding we go ear tags selected grazing environments to reduce scratches and scars and research into the best methods of dealing with the parasites such as regular treatment with topical treatments particularly the brand regular shearing which would also generate some form of byproduct which was proven extremely effective or even the more natural treatment of Dipping with whilst effective are harder to control and care must be taken not to allow the animal to ingest the product to avoid poisoning although with good practices in place this would be minimise National campaign on treatment of animals in all regions at the same time since the disease is easily transmittable molar Developed countries treat animals for all health reasons and realize the opportunity of res as a valuable byproduct Improve access to inputs chemical and accessories though strengthening of the current bonded warehouse system and inducing new investment Difficulty of importing chemicals accessories and components on time As a results tanner s and factories are not able to meet the buyers expected timeline and in some instances production comes to a halt Currently the bonded warehouse scenario is not functioning optically and not reaching the objective it was established for Weak planning coordination with inspection inefficiency and weak awareness by era higher transportation and warehouse costs final price being more expensive than direct import due to service fees and operational expenses are some of the reasons contributing to the inefficiency The major implications are delayed receipt of chemicals and if a chemical ingredient has to be substituted due to lack of availability then technically it may fail original specifications given Cascading from this stems the issue of product inconsistency and quality assurance Production can essentially come to a halt not only affecting the output but also causing untimely delays in completion or orders for export with shipping dates ultimately resulting in penalties of monetary value or forcing to air freight goods which is extremely expensive Capacity building of side to improve the bonded warehouse scheme Consider collaboration with private firms for management and operational support consider working with large chemical companies to bring in chemicals on consignment basis however side must have access to fore and be capitalized to ensure consignment delivery EIC to promote investment in chemicals and other inputs manufacturing lin the long run side to develop a mechanism to work with input in major input supplying countries china italy India to facilitate bulk procurement moth in usa uk china it is often found that bonded warehouses are run by private firms and have a fully digitalis interface to

essentially be a resource as a centre of excellence It should be aware of all the latest technologies that are available and build prototype examples of such technologies on all raw material types The opportunity here is to act as a genuine resource for the leather industry where tanners can go not only to see new developments but be able to run trials Reform the management structure to function as profit centre similar to care central leather research institute based in indian Introduce profit sharing model from the earnings of lid with the who are engaged in developing new Partner with international research institutions and with private to develop new products Develop partnership with international chemical companies research centres and jointly develop products using latest chemicals and Ethiopian raw materials The idea is to the small scale development centre which includes wet drums 600 my width roller crater equipped with the necessary varying types of rollers and small spray line That way numerous trials can be generated on a daily basis not only for genuine academic research and development but also creation of export market related leathers Develop practical

laboratories for quality assurance The opportunity here is for tanner s and factories to have a private section for leather developments away from the public setup of lily In addition it will serve as a centre where chemical companies can visit and use the facilities to assist in showing new chemical based technologies Competitive advantage is a key factor in securing and maintaining customers with interests of new product development in confidentiality The development centre can also be utilised for scaling up trials larger quantity salesmen samples before going in to bulk production furthermore the laboratory can provide results and feedback on bulk production as well as for red This is critical in that export leathers must be supplied conforming top technical standards such colour vastness strength water resistance etc and suppliers should provide batch test results to the customer for QA reassurance red and Laboratory Equipment cape purchases should qualify a tax rebate

rel certification which are key compliance requirements globally Limited improvement and investment in technology and innovations as per international buyer requirements and standards Poor production management leg is now an internationally recognised standard and is an independent body made up of chemical suppliers tanners and brands The standard was introduced to generate two outcomes firstly to ensure tanner s were operating responsibly with regards to the environment and secondly and often missed by tanner s in developing countries to create a framework where efficiency of processing can occur and consequently save costs By becoming certified it will give rise to export opportunities and establish the tannery as a world player ass are varied but do share a common theme Brands typically impose stringent rel legislation and as such their products must conform to ensure that restricted substances are either not used or under certain limits in the final article Without rel testing there are barriers to entry to supply many of the leading global brands doc is a newer initiative that is driving mail s material Restricted Substance lists but it creates opportunity in that understanding of this initiative means that working with chemical companies who abide by doc will ensure that chemicals sourced from them will almost certainly conform to brand It is recommended that existing and new FDI tanner s must attain leg Bronze or higher The domestic tanner s would be provided a 5 year window and dis would be provided 2 year window The ambition is by all tanner s based in Ethiopia would be leg certified This would attract quality leather product factories to base their manufacturing in ethiopian As an incentive the leg certified tanner s will be provided with priority for fore allocation lid must setup a to support tanner s in their effort to be leg certified lid should coordinate with donor agencies to support the tanner s for preparatory activities for leg certification Develop an Ethiopian Restricted Substance List in line with leg based recommendations Tanners should aim to work with chemical companies embracing the doc initiative tanner s in other countries realise that to supply into the export market they need to embrace these initiatives The consumers in the EIC world are far more environmentally savvy these days and brands cannot afford to deal with suppliers that may not operate in a way that is environmentally unfriendly nor respectful of toxic substances in final articles leg certification has now become a globally recognized standard Put in place a process control system based on leg standards so that tanners conform to specifications Absence of modern industrial production management system Lack of quality management system The opportunity here is to train staff to be fully aware of essential processing control technologies and link these in with leg protocols where possible As noted earlier the leg is not only to help the brands but can significantly improve the efficiency of the tannery in terms of water energy usage etc The aspect here is one of changing mentality where currently basic inputs of water energy etc are either cheap or free and thus effectively mistreated and squandered There needs to be a culture instilled irrespective of legs in that If you can measure it then you can control it so that constant processing improvement review can be generated The implication is reduced costs in the transformation of the leather and thus a potential competitive advantage in a better selling price and more consistent product or if so desired a greater profit margin furthermore control of processing parameters should give far more consistent leather as required for the export market lid to develop training program for tannery technical experts on process control and develop a guideline that would be publicly available lid can collaborate with care and Institute of creative leather technologies

Encourage the principle of pum planned Preventative maintenance through private service providers and consultants operate with multiple machines produced by multiple manufacturers making planned maintenance services more complex Lack of machinery maintenance services within country Without pump face significant impact on productivity It is critical for tanner s and factories to have equipment functioning optically at all times If a machine breaks down it can cause a cascade of effects regarding production output and delivery times As such pum is a critical aspect to ensure that machines are serviced at regular intervals to avoid production capacity issues In addition by having this service close by on the mojo cluster and being able to service numerous the business proposition is attractive for one company to provide this service albeit that they may call in service technicians from the machine manufacturers if so required Furthermore it may remove a further barrier in that they will carry an inventory of spares thus avoiding fore issues relating to machinery that currently manifest itself Finally they will be trained in setting up the machines to operate at optimal efficiency and provide the necessary skill set in producing consistent and high grade machine operations within the leather transformation process lid to have a list of potential institutions and encourage by providing continuous information to the industry actors lid Developed tanner s and factories apply pum as an essential part of their business International expert support to ensure that

they will bring International level thinking and strategy to the business and be able to train and educate staff not only for the immediate business climate but also to understand and adapt to future scenarios that will occur however this will come at a significant cost and there must be enough commitment both financial and management based to support the upgrading of the business in general This has been tried by bringing in technical experts which could have had much more impact if the experts were to have supported the entire business production process as opposed to just technical lid to develop a of international experts that can be hired by tanner s and factories lid s training service supported by international experts will develop a pool of local consultant in future Seek support

international buyers brands on how to enter new market spaces and maintain close follow up with business leads and other actors Lack of budget planning andlor limited willingness to allocate marketing funds understanding Limited digital presence of strategic importance of The Sales and Marketing process has become more complex in modern times and so it must be completed effectively Marketing in the leather industry like many other manufacturing industries is now more about how to satisfy the customer and their needs The opportunity of sales agents effectively reduces internal burden of marketing as they already understand the needs of the customer and can relay this information accurately and quickly to generate genuine sales possibilities The overall implication is that sales and marketing has a cost possibly higher than what the industry is used to when it used to sell leather now the game has changed and consequential a degree of investment has to be made ella would identify commission agents in Ethiopia and major exporting destinations tanner s and product factories should engage with these commission agents and invest in marketing activities Digital presence designed with the customer and consumer in mind including social media with regular content update in order to prove that the business appreciates and understand the modern day world Private sector ella Sales agents are still extremely important in the global competitive environment not only for their networking aspect and rapid opportunity potential but also to avoid conflicts of interest we go some brands are very competitive and so if supplies Brand a it effectively cannot supply to Brand be Here the sales agent is an effective customer and manage opportunities well Leading have very slick websites full of information that customers desire very professional and indicate that the company is one of excellence and extremely well managed Examples are wow come wow come wow come wow com Development partners Input supplies Production process Recommendations focusing on Export and Investment Export and Investment Year 4 Year 5 1 Enable domestic tanner s to transact in foreign currency for selling recommendations finished leather to the product factories who are exporting 2 Targeting international brands and manufacturers for increased export and to induce new investment in Ethiopia 3 Investment promotion via industrial park Enable domestic tanner s with indirect exports to access us Limited fore availability for tanner s to import inputs such as chemicals Ethiopia is facing a chronic fore crisis which is affecting the leather industry as it depends on import of chemicals and other foreign inputs leading to delays within the production process For tanner s to continue to supply the leather sector they need access to fore and in the instances that they transact with FDI product manufacturers consider allowing a proportion of that transaction to be in forest Consider to allow us based transactions for indirect exporters Government to allocate a certain percentage of fore for the indirect export value through the national bank to ensure tanner s have access to fore o moth This scenario was employed in a similar fashion by taipan and China many years ago not only for leather but for many industries including fix garments sector us based transaction in ipso Targeting international brands and manufacturers for increased export and induce new investment in Ethiopia Limited initiatives and interventions in promoting and branding Ethiopia as sourcing and investment hub Most of the investment promotion is generic and doesn t apply specifically for leather industry as has been done for garments The leather industry is constrained by lack of new foreign investment in the last six years and it is absolutely crucial to bring quality foreign investment to achieve increased export performance and employment For the footwear industry Ethiopia needs to target international brands The process will sourcing from some existing factories crucial to ensure existing manufacturers are supplying the export market successfully This will send a message in the manufacturing industry leading to more manufacturers interested in investment in ethiopian The ago opportunity is crucial to the manufacturers which can be optimized Brands are the leading force in the footwear industry so it s crucial that Ethiopian leather sector is able to work with anchor brands which will work as domino effect for increased export and new investment Gloves are classed as accessories and very few brands operate distinct loving departments instead brands tend to rely upon the glove manufacturers to bring them possibilities not only in materials but new glove designs and pricing options therefore for gloves instead to targeting brands the tactic would be to target top glove manufacturers to invest in ethiopian lid can play a crucial role with EIC to promote new investment based on product development capacity of ethiopian fix china India and Viet Nam followed such tactic for the last 20 years to generate investment and increased export in their respective countries lid Anchor brands and international experts worked closely with relevant ministry and investment agencies to promote products and incentives to manufacturers Investment promotion via Industrial Parks Limited new investment in Ethiopia in leather goods manufacturing From the currently operational ups adama hole semi ii aisha are capable of hosting leather goods manufacturers In addition George Shoe and fujian are constructing ups that are dedicated for leather goods manufacturing The Ethiopian Investment Commission should design and implement a focused investment promotion in selected countries to attract leather manufacturing dis The focus shall be on key manufacturers who are leading across selected categories of products The investment promotion shall also target key value chain actors for the leather goods manufacturing such as chemical manufacturers and suppliers leather product accessory manufacturers and packaging material producers ensuring added cost competitiveness and meeting lead time and quality requirements of the international market BIC italy Turkey and India have used Industry Parks and special economic zones to promote FDI and local investment aggressively The IPs and zones are integrated along the value chain with key suppliers of components chemicals machinery and other inputs having service centres in place Recommendations focusing on Environment Environment Increased checks of tanner s for installing primary and secondary treatment . plant This is to be accelerated via got investment in construction Policy 2 Put in place a standard guide for responsible water usage Finalize the mojo Common Effluent Treatment Plan plant Technical construction recommendations Increased and systematic checks of tanner s for installing primary and secondary treatment plant This is to be accelerated via got investment in construction noncompliance with era and buyers requirement on waste water treatment Heavy pollution and poor sector image for Ethiopia internationally There is no reason why effluent discharges originating from Ethiopian tanner s should be failing era standards The standards have been in place a long time lid has been completing effluent testing and yet still the tanner s did not seem to fully comply This resulted in a Government crackdown recently forcing Primary and secondary et s to be installed But the progress is slow In addition the tanner s could have gone some way to basic process efficiency steps in order to drop the effluent discharge loading The implication is that the tanner s are polluting the environment and not conforming to era standards based upon the latest figures supplied Ethiopia cannot afford an environmental disaster either in tangible terms of pollution in the country nor bad media possibilities furthermore it is not wise that dis are allowed to enter the Ethiopian leather industry and not have et s installed from the onset of the tannery building phase fbi s should automatically realise that they need to operate with et s and how damaging poor effluent can be to the environment and as such are simply abusing the situation and opportunity in the country All tanner s not involved with a cette need to have fully operational effluent treatment facilities both primary and secondary that comply with Ethiopian era values as a minimum and produce a regular official reporting mechanism to ensure compliance Failure to comply will mean licences are revoked until proof of compliance Any new investors domestic or did will need to prove compliance within three months of commissioning the tannery Random checks by era to occur Within 12 months timeline of the tanner s should come under random checks Such intensive checks should continue next few years to ensure greater compliance by the got would setup a fund to invest via grants by donors or zero interest loans for funding on a basis of the initial capital required to construct the treatment plants o moth china italy indian Vietnam all have very strict rule on implementation of era rulings spa India has a policy to invest in of the required finance for construction to be environmentally compliant Federal government invests and regional government invests Put in place a standard guide for responsible water usage Miss use of water Water is treated as natural resource which is abundance in supply Absence of flow meters to measure water input and discharge Water is treated as a free resource as it mainly comes from borehole There is a poor attitude to the use of water and understanding its value simply through not even bothering to measure how much is used Such a stance is not tolerated by many of the brands and thus again it will become an environmental based barrier to with many of the export markets The use of water must be considered through introduction of water flow meters so that the amount of water coming in to the tannery can be recorded and referenced against the volume of leather produced The target set will be according to the leg audit protocol it will be mandatory for all the tanner s to install the water flow meters and tracking of water usage The data will be regularly recorded and shared with lid to ensure the target is met lid playing support role Global tanner s recognize water consumption recording as a central activity era playing regulatory role Finalize the mojo Common Effluent Treatment Plan plant construction noncompliance with era and buyers on waste water treatment requirement Poor functioning effluent plant at firm level and huge investment cost to install a fully operational effluent treatment plant Heavy pollution and poor sector image for Ethiopia internationally Is absolutely crucial to the development ot the industry and minimise the cost of production for while comply to global standard is a sensible way to address effluent treatment tor large scale manufacture of leather within a cluster so long as it is built correctly and to an extremely high standard in truth it should be used as a valuable marketing tool for the Ethiopian leather industry It will bring about reassurance that ALL effluent is treated correctly and discharged to specified standards which would be a massive benefit to the country considering that the tanner s with currently operating et s do not seem to even be able to comply with era standards The let s would likely charge using a cost matrix based upon the amount of water discharged and the various effluent loading categories we go chromium nail body code etc and this way the tanner s cannot cheat they could reduce or levels in their feed to the cept by diluting with twice as much water Consequently water meters would be installed to record this This would in turn drive the tanner s to review their processing efficiencies and realise that they must use less water throughout the transformation process This in turn would drive a better stance on the utilization of water being such a valuable resources Other benefits are likely to be that let s effluent treatment would be significantly cheaper than if the tannery were completing it by themselves and as such drive greater price competitive advantage to their sales o cept of very high standards must be constructed in the mojo proposed cluster The contractor for this must not simply be awarded on price but through proof of successful implementation in other countries and validated by a number of experts leg certified auditor should be part of the advisory board to ensure the right contractor is selected of global standard and is supervised during the construction process The cette being a enterprise would need to also look at continuous improvement and various technologies that could upgrade the system over time as the handling of wastewater and treatment systems is constantly evolving EIC china italy India have clusters of tanner s with cette moth used a contractor selected based on cost and as such the facility is not unto global standards and has generated even further bad press for their sector Recommendations focusing on incentives coordination logistics and Customs Custom and Logistic Incentives and Coordination incentives need to be introduced and structured around the need of the sector Create a joint taskforce between key supporting institutions to serve as Policy a central coordinating body to drive necessary change recommendations in Set logistic competitiveness target and establish custom window dedicated to leather Introduce performance based new incentives for value addition and improve management of existing incentive mechanisms Absence of export performance based incentives Manufacturers unable to gain full benefits from voucher system incentives Material list consumption per product and material naming in the input output coefficient is not regularly updated does not reflect regular changes in finished products landscape As part of the incentive mechanism the got has put out includes the voucher system by which manufacturers get duty drawback for the inputs they have imported and used for export however the system including the coefficient is not easy to work with nor is it regularly updated to reflect the latest input requirement of the global market This is causing manufacturers not to take full
