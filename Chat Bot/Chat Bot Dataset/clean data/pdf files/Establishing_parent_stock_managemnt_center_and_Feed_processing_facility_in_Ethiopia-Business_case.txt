Organization Establishing a Parent Stock Management Centre and Feed Processing Facility in Ethiopia Business case The ILO Ethiopia Project August 2022 On behalf of Supported by oy Invest for Jobs 4 fever ministry 4 Opportunities for Growth in Africa for Economic Cooperation and Development. Government of Ethiopia German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development International Labour Organization Foreign Currency A Market System Analysis of the Poultry sector in sigma and Ethiopia The Ethiopian Investment Commission The Agricultural Transformation Agency Gross Domestic Product The Growth and Transformation Plan ii Day Old Chickens Executive summary injure the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development funded ILO Ethiopia project conducted a Market System Analyses of the poultry sector In the report in order to facilitate growth of the poultry sector reducing the cost of poultry farming was identified as one of the key intervention areas Following that recommendation the ILO in consultation with the Ministry of Agriculture moan and other relevant stakeholders took on the assignment of developing a business case to assess the efficacy and relevance for establishing grandparent multiplication and feed processing facility in Ethiopia which could potentially lead to a reduction in input costs for the poultry sector The business case study aims to provide key the government and potential a analysis to improve binding constraints in the sector and present a call to action Despite subsequent efforts by the Government of Ethiopia goes and development partners the poultry sector in Ethiopia remains at its early stage To stir growth of the sector the got has set out an ambitious target in its perspective plan with a goal of doubling both eggs and chicken meat production This target could be achieved only if the binding constraints in the sector including poor productivity of chicken breeds short supply of docs and shortage of feed are resolved The underlying condition from where these challenges are born such as the shortage of foreign currency lack of grandparent management farm and increasing cost of inputs for feed production must be addressed Addressing these challenges starts with understanding the market potential of the poultry sector Ethiopia has one of the largest chicken populations in Africa but is lagging in per capita consumption of eggs and chicken consuming two to lower than African peer countries however the average low consumption trend in the country is an indication of the considerable potential that the Ethiopian market holds urbanization increasing income and the emerging low middleclass communities in Ethiopia are expected to improve consumption and significantly increase demand in the Suppliers of poultry products can reap the economic benefits resulting from these changes however to realize these economic and social gains inputs such as DOCs and feed at affordable prices must be abundantly available At the back of this rationale the business case for investing in establishing a parent stock management and feed processing centre has been found to be a viable economic opportunity This study envisage setting up this poultry centre that would have the capacity to produce 15 million DOCs and tons of poultry feed annually The total investment cost to establish the centre is estimated to be us 14.17 million and could be operational in 18 to 36 months For both production lines inputs including parent stock premium etc will need to be imported while other inputs such as maize and soybean will be sourced locally Based on conservative estimates a cost

organization 2021 over seven years The investment project will also create direct employment for over 400 people and will have an immense social and economic impact in the country The centre or investment project could be explored in various forms including bringing an investment to establish the poultry sector partner with existing feed producers and or exploring potential partnerships with cooperatives and unions A staged approach could also be explored where production could start in phases and would be scaled based on the market adoption The study importantly confirmed some of the initial findings of the ma that the Ethiopian market is currently not mature enough for setting up a grandparent multiplication centre The demand for eggs and poultry meat in Ethiopia is low and there is uncertainty about the capacity of the market to absorb increased production of poultry products further the investment risk of grandparent multiplication centre is high due to poor insecurity and lack of experienced human resources Due to these constraints the business case for setting up grandparent multiplication centre in Ethiopia is not there yet however with a longterm vision of realizing this goal the goes along with the private sector can support development of the market create a conducive policy framework and assurance and avail necessary infrastructure for investors looking to explore the opportunity When these major requirements are fulfilled then the business case for establishing a grandparent multiplication centre could become evident in five to seven years 1. Introduction Project introduction The Ethiopia project has been funded by the biz Special Initiative on Training and Job Creation to support Ethiopia to develop its potential and create more and better jobs To do this the project puts forward an integrated strategy combining policy support and social dialogue skills development enterprise development and entrepreneurship training with the ultimate objective of creating decent job opportunities for women and young men in the selected fruit and vegetables poultry and edible oil The project will develop the capacity of national regional and local stakeholders to develop and implement policies aimed at boosting the job creation potential of the agribusiness sector while enhancing decent work conditions Ethiopia had conducted a Market System Analyses for the poultry sectors in ethiopian The key finding of the analysis shows that imported exotic breeds are typically more productive both in meat and eggs and rearing periods for imported breeds are about half that of indigenous breeds however to import these parent stocks for DOCs multiplication in ethiopian companies need to wait for a long queue to access foreign currency When fore becomes available there usually is an of DOCs in the market which exacerbates inconsistency of supply In addition import of parent stock is associated with high mortality rate during transportation which increases cost of operation In addition an analysis conducted by the Ethiopia Investment Commission reich and the Agricultural Transformation Agency data indicated that having a grandparent stock multiplication centre within Ethiopia would reduce the DOC price by 55 per cent 3 by reducing mortality rate of DOCs during transit from abroad and the demand for fore to import parent stocks This could eventually increase domestic demand for chicken meat and eggs leading to a positive change in the average consumption patterns of the Ethiopian population and hence enhance opportunities for the export market which would in turn make the multiplication centre more sustainable Against this backdrop the ILO Ethiopia Project has commissioned the development of a business case for investing in the poultry sector in ethiopian specifically establishing a grandparent multiplication centre and feed processing and provide the government with data and analysis thereby supporting development of the poultry sector and addressing the major bottlenecks that limit its potential During the initial phases of this study it was understood that introducing a grandparent multiplication centre in Ethiopia would first require fulfilling many important prerequisites from the government investors and the market are currently not in place consequently the focus of the business case was shifted to establishing a parent stock management centre however the business case will also provide insights on the foundational work that is needed to establish grandparent management centre in the long terms 2 A Market Systems analysis of the Poultry ethiopian International Labour organization 2021 3 Food and Beverages Processing and Auxiliary Industry strategy nice 2020. Study purpose and scope Several value chain assessment reports conducted on the poultry sector in Ethiopia have identified lack of grandparent multiplication centres and adequate supply of feed as the main bottlenecks to poultry production growth Based on this premises this business case report sets out to show the critical pieces that need to come together to make setting up a parent stock management centre a viable investment opportunity Meeting the demands of such kind of venture requires an active and coordinated participation of regulators and the private sector hence the business case study endeavours to provide a insight on the potential of the sector and whet the appetite of public and private take the necessary steps towards realizing the goal of setting up a parent stock management centre soon The business case study assesses various aspects of setting up a parent stock management centre in ethiopian These include the policy and regulatory framework the market potential the technical requirements financial viability and the socioeconomic impact of the investment project The scope of the business case study includes 1. Policy and Regulatory framework Providing a review of key policies and strategies planned and ongoing that affect development of the poultry sector with a view of their impact on the investment project itself 2. The Market potential Assessing both domestic and export market potentials including describing the key trade agreements that Ethiopia benefits from and presenting unique value to investors In addition the study will analyze local competition and identify key success factors Risks related to market and project implementation and their potential mitigation strategies are identified 3. Technical assessment This exercise includes Describe the type scale and business model of the feed processing and parent stock management centre drawing lessons from African countries that have built efficient and sustainable parent stock centres Defining the organizational structure governance model and staffing needs for the proposed venture including identifying the technical skills needed to successfully establish and operate the venture Identifying the technical needs we go construction machinery equipment systems etc of setting up a parent stock management centre including estimating the cost of capital expenditure inputs for production and working capital Designing an implementation plan considering the various licensing and regulatory processes related to setting up such kind of venture sourcing of capital goods identifying and hiring human resources etc 4 ethiopians Food and Beverages Processing and Auxiliary Industry strategy ata 2021 4. Financial viability Developing a full financial model including income statement balance sheet cash flow statement scenario analysis etc to assess financial viability of the investment project and employing profitability ratios to determine return on investment 5. socioeconomic impact The study provides a analysis of the socioeconomic benefits and impact of investing in a parent stock management and feed processing facility Based on the above scope the study provides analyses and showcases what is required to set up the intended project While the report reflects the current thinking of stakeholders sufficient efforts are made to provide recommendations in recognition of the goal of the government and potential shift in consumption of poultry Study methods The business case was developed using a approach 1. Desk review Both qualitative and quantitative data was gathered through literature reviews These included national development plans of ethiopian value chain assessment reports as well as research and analyses on the sector conducted by development partners and researchers further the desk research included reviewing examples of other countries in Africa that have passed through a similar growth trajectory to draw lessons and best practices Targeted interviews Primary research was conducted in addis ababa bashir dark sendoff and harass in March 2022. Interviews were carried out with a diverse pool of participants including government officials producer associations commercial farms farms researchers and potential investors During this phase over 25 businesses and organizations were interviewed The interviews provided a deep insight into the business case for setting up the envisioned project Consumers survey To complement the interviews over 150 consumers and retailers were surveyed to gather and analyze data about demand drivers consumers behaviours and market trends The analysis provided the inputs needed to determine the market size for the sector What is a Business case A business case provides justification for undertaking a project It evaluates the benefit cost and risk of alternative options and provides a rationale for the preferred solution From Association of Project Manager definition am orgy uk resources what is project management what is a business case The findings of this study were validated in a workshop organized on 14 July 2022 attended by ILO partners and relevant public and private sector representatives At the workshop over 30 participants discussed the findings and recommendations and provided their feedback which have been incorporated in the final revision of this report list of participants Annex Report structure The report first provides a background on policy directions for the poultry sector It then looks at the business case from the demand and supply perspective This is followed by a detailed assessment of the investment proposal section finally the report describes the foundational work that needs to be explored to set up grandparent management centre in the long term section 2. The Landscape of the Poultry Sector 2.1 Background The agriculture sector is one of the major pillars of the Ethiopian economy Due to the vast astronomically favourable land and high number of livestock in ethiopian the sector has been consistently driving the broader economic growth Agriculture is the major employer in Ethiopia with over 80 per cent of the population relying on agricultural development The sector contributes an average of 33 per cent to the Gross Domestic Product of Ethiopia and has grown by 5.3 per cent annually since 20105. Since the early the government has introduced several policies and strategies to stir and maintain growth of agriculture The industrialization agenda has helped to generate the fiscal monetary and human capital required for the ambitious infrastructure investment that Ethiopia has taken under the consecutive Growth and Transformation Plan gap iike The development gains from the sector have aided in uplifting domestic incomes and thus helping to strengthen domestic demand Despite this achievement the agriculture sector has been lagging compared to the growth of the industry and services sectors The gap of Ethiopia was estimated to have grown by an average 8.7 per cent in the gap II period placing Ethiopia as one of the fastest growing economies globally however average growth of the agriculture sector was 4.1 per cents and only 50 per cent of the target were achieved Within agriculture the livestock growth is further 3.5 per cent average growth was exhibited during the implementation of gap and gap ILO specifically poultry production has remained at an early stage despite its potential to raise the incomes of farmers 90 per cent of Ethiopian chickens are indigenous indicates low productivity and high mortality rates This problem combined with the high cost of feed have made the sector largely and focused on only ESG production The potential of the sector to improve income satisfy food and nutritional needs create jobs and play a catalytic role in the country s economic development remains untapped To remedy the lagging growth of the livestock sector the Perspective Development Plan has set out to increase productivity of the livestock sector by improving breeds feeding and healthcare and thereby meeting the demand for industrial inputs increasing export earnings and making greater contribution to the overall economic growth During implementation of the plan it is targeted to increase the contribution of the livestock sector to overall agricultural production from 28 per cent to 38 per cents 5 The Perspective plan Ethiopia Planning and Development commission 2021 The Agriculture Sector Development plan Ministry of agriculture 2021 7 bid particularly improving the output of the poultry sector has been identified as a priority The plan targets to increase ESG production from the production Chicken Meat production current estimate of 2.8 billion pieces to 5.5 billion million pieces Thousand Tones pieces by 2030 and chicken meat production from 48 thousand tons to 106 thousand tons Figure Growth Target for the Poultry Sector Given the nutritional value of both chicken meat and eggs production growth is expected to enable Ethiopia to meet its growing population s demand and even produce a surplus for 2021 2030 2021 2030 industrial use andlor export In addition the poultry sector has an immense potential to create job opportunities especially to women and the youth Relative to other sectors poultry farming requires a low amount of capital to start and with the right training can be well managed by farmers The sector is marked as one that has the potential to increase income for farmers thereby improving their livelihoods Achieving the targets set in the plan calls for improvements in available chicken breeds access to input for poultry farming access to finance and adoption of best practices in farming To bring about the desired pectoral transformation the key levers have been identified as increasing production of and increasing feed production and supply To this effect the government has set a goal to establish one national and four regional grandparent stock multiplication farms increase production of maize and soya bean and make significant investment in feed producing facilities Fiscal and incentives are offered by the government to encourage investments in the sector These include exemption for capital goods construction materials laboratory equipment and spare parts and income tax exemptions overall there is a need for significant public and private investment to address the gaps in production and distribution of quality input DOCs and feed to boost growth of the poultry sector 2.2 Market overview Demand for poultry products Ethiopia has been experiencing tremendous demographic and social changes that have increased demand for poultry products The Ethiopian population has almost doubled to 115 million since the turn of the millennium The country is still predominantly a rural country with only 20 per cent of people living in urban areas however the Central Statistics Agency estimates that the urban population will double to 42.3 million by 2037. In urban areas a middleclass community is also emerging which has increased demand for foods further driven by increasing tourism and changes in lifestyle the restaurant and hospitality sector are increasingly 8 The Agriculture Sector Development plan Ministry of agriculture 2021 A Market Systems analysis of the Poultry ethiopian International Labour organization 2021 10 Ethiopia livestock master plan Ministry of agriculture 2015 11 World Bank data 2020 why Should Ethiopians Care about urbanization World bank 2019 catering to diverse dishes In addition local and international brands specializing in chicken meat we go Pizza hut etc are gaining popularity among the growing young population These developments are contributing to an expanding poultry sector in ethiopian In urban households eggs and chicken meat are becoming part of the normal diet In a recent survey conducted in February it was observed that 98 per cent and 40 per cent of households in urban cities frequently consume eggs and chicken meat respectively however frequency of consumption for eggs is higher compared to chicken meat During the survey 96 per cent of participants indicated that they purchase eggs all year round while the case was the same for chicken meat with only 40 per cent of participants Despite some progress per capita consumption of eggs Figure Per capita consumption of eggs 2019 and chicken meat is still low in ethiopian In the per capita consumption of eggs in Ethiopia was estimated to be 0.38 go which lags behind its East African peers For several example consumption of eggs in kenya sedan and Kenya tanzanian are and higher than ethiopian respectively similarly consumption in ethiopian compared to the African go and global average go is and lower tanzanian Africa IN any 1.96 sedan hana Ethiopia is ranked among the lowest consumers of eggs globally at out of 161 countries The countries with the highest per capita consumption of eggs in Africa include Algeria tunisian go and South Ethiopia Africa ganda wanda Id is we While the ethiopians overall eggs consumption is low the case is relatively improving in the main urban areas For example residents in the capital addis ababa are estimated to consume an average 3.5 keg of eggs annually which is higher than the country average Urban cities are the main market outlet for backyard and commercial poultry producers due to higher purchasing power and of urban residents hence although still below the far recommended intake of 4.5 keg per years consumption of eggs is significantly higher in urban areas compared to the rural population likewise per capita consumption of chicken meat in Ethiopia is one of the lowest in the world In the country ranked at 159 place out of 161 countries with an annual consumption of 0.69 go only better than Chad and African peers such as kenya sedan wanda and ganda consume or more poultry meat compared to the poultry meat market in Ethiopia is still at an infant stage 13 Invest

library 2019 Consumption of poultry meat is heavily affected by religious practices like fasting Orthodox christians the dominant religion practiced in ethiopian has some 250 fasting days during the years about 180 considered obligatory During this period many members abstain from consuming eggs and poultry meat as a results demand falls significantly This affects market consistency and contributes to the low per capita consumption in the country On the contrary at the end of the fasting period which is usually followed by religious holidays demand for eggs and chicken meat reaches its peasant often results in price hikes and shortage of supply In terms of preference many Ethiopians opt for procuring live chicken and slaughter themselves During interviews consumers have indicated that buying live chicken gives them peace of mind they need not worry about when the chicken was slaughtered how it was slaughtered whether it is organic or not etc This consumption preference presents of insecurity for producers and has been deterring commercial processing of chicken meat Per capita is also affected by a approach to consuming chicken meat in ethiopian Chicken meat is mainly used to make chicken sauce door wot and making this dish is costly and time it is not a dish made frequently As a results this lack of diversity in making chicken based dishes affects demand for poultry meat clearly Ethiopia is yet to make poultry meat consumption an integral part of the normal diet as the case is in other developing countries in african For example West African countries such as several and hana have a poultry meat per capita consumption of 7 keg or above which is higher than ethiopian Unlike ethiopian chicken meat is used in diversified cuisines like street foods fried chicken roasted chicken etc in these countries however the average low per capita consumption of eggs and poultry meat is also an indication of the considerable potential for growth that the Ethiopian market holds Poultry is one of the most affordable nutritious foods and many families in Ethiopia are becoming aware about its impact on health and reducing malnutrition in children In addition several initiatives are underway to create led by the government and development organizations The impact of these initiatives coupled with increasing awareness and growing purchasing power is expected to increase demand for eggs and poultry meat To satisfy the potential demand growth for eggs and poultry meat and commercial farms need to increase their supply however farmers can only increase supply if equipment and inputs such as feed supplements and vaccines are available Poultry farmers are constantly raising concerns about availability and quality of these inputs especially feed Because feed constitutes up to per cent of the cost of poultry production its quality and availability directly affects the performance of farmers In addition quality feed has the potential to increase carcass yield and eggs production hence affects profitability of poultry farming 18 Fasts Feasts in the Ethiopian Orthodox tradition 2021 19 Consumption of poultry meat far library 2019 20

value of over us 157 million In demand was projected to reach over tons while supply would remain below The unmei demand for poultry meat is expected to be addressed by increasing local production In addition to local supply Ethiopia has a strategic vocational advantage to compete internationally Ethiopia is centrally located in the global economy and has proximity to the key markets of african Middle east and europe The East and North African markets alone are estimated to be valued over us 3 billion and are largely and growing Ethiopia is a member of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa with preferential access to regional market of over 400 million people In addition the country has accepted to join African Continental Free Trade Area an agreement that will allow free market access in the continent further Ethiopian airlines the largest carrier in african makes Ethiopia a strategic location to establish businesses and serve the greater African market Ethiopian currently serves a network of over 125 passenger and 44 freighter destinations It connects Ethiopia to 57 destinations in african providing ease of access to African markets Ethiopian currently is the main carrier to import frozen chicken and DOCs to Ethiopia and would be a key partner for investors looking to produce and export poultry products With the right product and strategy producers can effectively compete in this growing African and international market and become an alternative sourcing hub Supply of poultry products Ethiopia has the largest livestock population in Africa with a record of more than 200 million In the chicken population was estimated to reach 56.8 million Over the past 10 years growth of the chicken population has been stagnant with an average growth of 3 per cents Growth has been limited due to high mortality rate of chickens In alone over 39 million deaths were recorded Low adaptation of exotic breeds diseases and predators prevalent in the scavenging

the most preferred layer chickens for commercial use while cobb Ross 308 and hubbard are preferred for broiler production sassy a hybrid breed is also popular among farms that are looking for chickens In fact due to their higher survival rate and less dependency on commercial feed the sassy are the dominant exotic breeds in the rural community however the productivity of sassy is lower compared to other exotic breeds Over the past decades production of poultry meat has remained relatively constant in ethiopian Production peaked in 2015 when it reached tons and dipped in 2019 with production volume of tons The growth is an indication of the poor poultry meat consumption culture in the country that has prevailed during the period In addition several challenges hindering the growth of

One of the challenges in the Ethiopian poultry sector is lack of Figure import of DOCs in Ethiopia parent stocks Because there is no grandparent multiplication centre in ethiopian commercial farms depend on periodically imported parent stocks In the past three years alone 1.3 million DOCs were imported however the trend shows that imports . of parent stocks have declined due to lack of fore and disruption of flights from Europe following the spread of the pandemic Discussions with commercial farms have revealed that during the pandemic some were forced to discard DOCs due to reduced demand for poultry products in the hospitality sector The poultry sector has several having significant disrupting power Lack of fore is one of such challenges Supply of machinery remix and parent stocks rely on imports As a results when fore is scarce supply of poultry feed DOCs and medicines is affected Shortage of imported premium combined with increasing cost of other feed inputs we go maize soya etc increases cost of feed production which is ultimately transferred to poultry farmers In addition brokers in the market distort prices as well as buy and feed and DOCs at higher prices to farmers There are also other financial barriers to improve eggs production including access to finance to increase layer and broiler stock The combined negative effect of these challenges is huge and in some instances have led poultry farms into bankruptcy For example in February it was reported that 15 to 20 30 far state 2022 31 Other resources such as the Ethiopian Ministry of Agriculture indicate eggs production is double the amount indicated by far 52 frequently asked questions Stat 33 Data collected from Ministry of agriculture 2022.

Setting Up a Parent Stock Management and Feed Processing Centre 3.1 The investment proposal The objective of the investment the poultry centre is twofold establishing a parent stock management centre that produces and distributes commercial chicks for poultry farmers and setting up a feed processing plant that supplies both to its centre and poultry farmers Depending on the absorption capacity of the market the centre might engage in production of poultry eggs and meat for urban and rural markets in the long term to improve demand for poultry products curtain on imports and save foreign exchange Based on the current market conditions the poultry centre will start with a facility that has the capacity to breed parent stocks to produce over 15 million DOCs and tons of poultry feed annually Since there are no grandparent management centres in ethiopian the poultry centre will need to import parent stocks from breeding companies from which fertilized eggs can be raised and hatched to produce DOCs of three types layers boilers and deals The mix of DOCs will be determined based on market demand To complement its supply of docs the poultry centre will produce and supply starters rearing pulled growers finisher and other types of feed to farmers The product mix for feed will be for layer and broiler chickens although production of broiler feed might increase during holiday seasons The total investment cost to establish the centre is estimated to be us 14.17 million From the total about 46 per cent will be spent on constructing an efficient DOCs production and feed processing facility Machinery and equipment for the poultry centre need to be imported by reputable suppliers Because importing inputs for parent stock and feed dependent on fore availability and personality of agricultural production operating the poultry centre will be a endeavour hence 12 per cent of the investment will be earmarked for working capital Table Investment cost of setting up the poultry centre Description Cost Parentage in US dollars Share Construction of the Facilities 46 Machinery and Equipment 25 Vehicles 6 Furniture and Fixtures 8 Costs 4 Working Capital 12 91 Contingency 9 TOTAL INVESTMENT COST 100 15 The investment project is expected to be funded 100 per cent by equity capital from potential investors To debris the investment investors might explore potential debt financing from international financial service providers however because securing such debt might take longer time implementation of the project could be delayed To avoid such delays we recommend commencement of the project only after the full funding for the investment is secured Various cost elements might show variations due to international and local cost drivers For example the working capital need could show significant increase if the price of major inputs continues rising in ethiopian As a results investors are recommended to reserve contingency fund of up to 10 per cent to mitigate this risk The investment project could be explored in various forms including bringing an investment to establish the poultry sector partner with existing feed producers and or exploring potential partnerships with cooperatives and unions A staged approach could also be explored where production could start in phases and would be scaled based on the market adoption 3.2 Target market The poultry centre will primarily target the local poultry farms The number of poultry farms in Ethiopia is not known however they provide the largest share of eggs and meat in the market Lack of sufficient DOCs and poultry feed are the two largest bottlenecks for the growth of poultry farms and supply of eggs and chicken meat in ethiopian As a results the domestic market offers an untapped potential to engage in the distribution of DOCs and poultry feed across ethiopian The market for the supply of poultry feed alone is estimated to be over us 160 million additionally recent changes on the supply and price of feed in the Ethiopian market show the viability of the local market Increasing cost of production has created shortage in supply and prices have been rising In some months the price has increased fourfold in just a years According to Ethiopia Poultry Producers and Processors Association the rising cost of poultry farming have forced fifteen to twenty farms to shut their operation in early 2022. To remedy the situation the engagement of the private sector is of paramount importance Producers that can navigate these challenges are positioned to become leading suppliers of both DOCs and poultry feed in the market Beyond the local market there is an attractive potential to export products Because the local market may not be able to absorb the full volume of DOCs produced initially the poultry centre must target export opportunities In addition shortage of feed is also apparent in the East and North African markets The total market of feed in these markets is valued as mare than us 2.9

the agreement comes into effect it will open new corridors for manufacturers to export their products to African countries Participating in trade shows and conferences is considered as the industry s norm to generate leads Several events to bring together key global and regional players are organized every years For example the ethic Poultry Expo held in addis ababa had gathered 114 exhibitors from 26 countries Such events provide the platform to find potential suppliers and buyers for the investment project As a results the project needs to allocate sufficient funds to leverage these conferences and build relationships with industry participants For feed the poultry centre can employ two sales strategies directly sell to commercial farms and distribute products through agents These strategies have in the company s sales and profitability For example while selling directly to commercial farms improves profit margins volume of distribution could be limited On the contrary using agents will require the poultry centre to offer its products at discounted prices but will increase its sales and value of profit A mix of these strategies can be utilized to reach both urban and rural markets and large and farms For docs due to the of mortality direct distribution is recommended Farmers can directly buy from the multiplication centre or the centre can provide delivery 3.3 Technical study Construction of the poultry centre When setting up a parent stock multiplication centre the amount of floor and feeder space is critical for optimal flock welfare and performance In different countries stock density might differ based on local legislation climate and season type system and quality of housing and equipment ventilation and quality assurance requirements While that is the case many parent stock multiplication centres recommend a stock density during rear days to be for male and for female This would mean for an operation that aims to rear birds at time there is a need to secure hectares of land to construct the parent stock multiplication centre Selecting the right areas for the investment project is critically important The poultry centre must be located as far as possible from other poultry operations and each phase of production should be treated as separate units The size relative situation and design of the facility should minimize transmission of pathogens between and within flocks The facility should be constructed in a way 17 that allows easy and thorough cleaning and the application of disinfectant The walls and roofs should contain insulation with a moisture barrier and rodent proof materials and ceiling height should be adequate for proper ventilation With electrically powered equipment it is essential to use a reliable source of electric power to operate electrical ventilation heating lighting and feeding equipment also it is essential to install standby generators and an appropriate alarm system in case of power failure Controlled or closed environment houses are the most popular form of ventilation system for parent stock due to the ability to provide better control of the internal environment under a range of ambient conditions DOC breeding farms must follow management programs recommended by the breeding company including stocking size feeding hatchery transportation etc If the feed processing facility were established in the same location then there is a need to secure additional hectares of land to build a separate feed processing site The facility must construct sufficient storage houses and residential houses Machines and equipment Both product lines of the investment project DOCs and poultry feed require a different set of machinery and equipment It is vital that the correct equipment

Since the production of maize has increased by an average 7.64 per cent however demand is higher than supply hence there is frequently shortage in the market especially because maize is used for households consumption as a staple 43 List of machines sourced from a Chinese supplier 44 The Agricultural Transformation Agency data has also developed a formulation manual for feed production 45 World Data atlas 2022 19 food poultry producers need to compete with humans to find supply of maize for processing In the the poultry centre needs to source maize from in the aroma we go way etc mara we go godamn and the inner regions As a results prices could be expected to be volatile as it would be affected by brokers margin For example at the time this report was under review price of maize was around us 470 per ton which was double what it used to be a year before The other key input for feed production is which might constitute per cent of the mix Although it accounts for only 4 per cent of pulses produced in ethiopian soybean production has increased by an average 12 per cent from 2015 to The country has produced tons of soybean in 2020 and productivity has been improving reaching 23.03 however because soybean is an export commodity up to 95 per cent exported supply is in shortage for local processing Since soybean is exclusively being traded at the Ethiopian Commodities Exchange and processors can source soybean only through this platform Like maize the price of soybean has increased recently trading at over us in March 2022. oiled cakes we go huge peanut sunflower soya etc are used as source of protein in the production of poultry feed and are sourced from oiled or traders If available oiled cakes can replace the need to process soybean to extract fat currently Ethiopia relies on imports to supply edible oil however significant efforts are underway to substitute imports with local production Large scale oiled processors are under Figure Potential composition of feed an estimated combined tons ingredients percentage of production capacity When these come into effect the supply of oiled cakes in the local market is expected to improve Even then processors might opt for Others exporting oiled cakes to generate forest so the up to poultry centre will need to compete aggressively premises add vitamins and other important mineral to Maize poultry feed making up per cent of the mix Because remix is not currently produced in ethiopian the poultry soybean centre would need access to fore to import Other up to inputs used in the production of poultry feed include wheat brand limestone salt etc and are sourced from local factories up to In the longterm it needs to establish direct relationship with farmers and engage in contract farming or explore potential backward integration into maize and soybean production Several factors including drought political stability and other competing crops are currently affecting the production volume of maize and soybean As a results have started to integrate 46 An interview with a poultry feed producer 47 Agriculture Survey report Central Statistics agency 2020 48 oiled processors under formation include Edible oil she Group mirror Group WA oil Factory richard and Nirvana processing 20 their factories with agriculture development To ensure sustainability the poultry centre needs to supplement raw materials sourcing from traders with its own portion of production we go per cent of maize could be grown alternatively it would be dependent on applicable policies maize andlor soybean could be imported As indicated above exploring the export market will allow the poultry centre to generate its own forest As much as the fore retention law in Ethiopia allows this resource could be used to import inputs without the need to apply for fore with local banks Investors can also import inputs using franco There is a need to address the lack of linkages in the poultry value chain Some inputs critical for poultry farming are available in the country but due to poor linkages are either wasted or sold at a different market For example avocado residues peel and seed a byproduct from avocado oil producing enterprises are rich in proteins that can be used in animal feed however the byproduct is currently being wasted because of poor linkages and lack of extraction technologies Oil cakes a byproduct from edible oil producers have a similar effect in improving feed production but is mostly exported to generate forest There is a need to develop policies to create linkages between agro processors and the poultry value chain and make these linkages economically viable for sustainable engagements 3.4 Organizational structure and staffing The poultry centre will need diverse human power to effectively manage its operation Although operating from different facilities corporate services of both the poultry farm and feed production units need will be centralized for effective integration The following depicts a organizational structure for the poultry centre Figure Organizational structure of the poultry centre manager Farm Nutrition Health quality sourcing Poultry Farm Manager Supervisor Supervisor insecurity Procurement Feed Processing Factory nutrition Quality sourcing Manager Formulation Supervisor Procurement Group CEO . Human . Finance ei Marketing red la Proper Corporate Services party Admin SpE Both production units require a specific skillet For example the DOC multiplication farm requires people with the following capabilities Franco value is a method of payment in which importing of goods is permitted through bank transfers without the need to open letter of credits Importers need to get a franco value permit from the National Bank of Ethiopia to use this method 50 Parent stock management manual Hendrix Genetics 21 Strong knowledge of animal husbandry sound knowledge of the biology and husbandry of chickens including how their needs may be best provided for in all circumstances Skills in animal husbandry demonstrable skills in observation handling care and treatment of chickens and problem detection and resolution Personal qualities affinity and love for chickens dedication and patience likewise the feed processing unit must be equipped with staff that have technical knowledge of feed production sourcing and distribution At full capacity the poultry centre will create jobs for over 400 employees 3.5 analysis Based on conservative estimates a analysis projects that an investment of us 14.1 million in establishing the parent stock multiplication and feed processing facility will generate an internal rate of return of 31 per cent over seven years The net present value of the investment project at 25 per cent discount rate is estimated to be over us 15 indicates an attractive value addition on invested capital It has the capacity to become a us million company in ten years

management farm and feed processing facility and should be considered as informative only Investors looking to explore this investment opportunity are advised to conduct a full feasibility study 23 3.6 Assessment of risks The following table details potential risks and mitigation strategies at different stages of the investment Table Assessment of potential risk to the investment project Nature of Risk Planning Risk Poor planning of activities might impact milestones and subsequent steps towards establishment Mitigation Approach Develop detailed plan of action to account for all steps necessary for establishing the venture Capital raising risk Investors might not be able to raise the full capital needed to establish the venture Leverage other forms of financing we go debt unkind investments etc to address the gap Delays in project implementation land infrastructure etc may not be available from the gov at the expected time Machinery and equipment suppliers might delay delivery of production lines Begin each step of inquiry and application as early as possible and continuously follow up Leverage and private push through the process Input sourcing Shortage fore to import inputs for production we go parent stock premium etc Increasing of locally sourced inputs might affect cost of production Explore potential ways to generate fore we go export Effectively plan for all sourcing and procurement needs have good buffer Engage in longterm contracts for key inputs for production Market risk Demand for poultry products may not increase as expected despite strong awareness creation campaigns Explore the export market as an alternative market destination Potentially explore into chicken meat processing Operational risk Diseases might threaten the whole flock and risk loss of investment Employee turnover could reduce efficiency knowledge transfer etc Employ strong insecurity measures to prevent an outbreak Continually provide training and development to employees provide compensation packages to retain staff Policy risk Policy directions might change unexpectedly affecting operation we go fore fore retention export of live chickens etc Work closely with the government to influence policy directions anticipate potential changes we go lobbying for a law that keeps parent stock management centres in isolation to ensure exempting such venture to import and export DOCs and feed etc Political risk Political unrest could jeopardize the whole investment Closely work with law enforcement to reduce the risk of damages during unrest 24 3.7 Implementation plan To implement the centre or investment project and begin operation in ethiopian potential investors will need to go through several steps Though it may vary from sector to sector the overall process until product launch might take 18 to 36 months Some of the steps listed below will overlap hence could reduce the total estimated time of project delivery Each of these activities could further be divided into multiple steps Table implementation plan Activities Launching discussion with government including site visits Signing MOU with key partners we go moan Conducting feasibility study to assess viability and determine production capacity Fund raising to collect investment capital Licensing and registration inv permit Construction of the facility Sourcing machinery s Installation of machinery and equipment Identifying and hiring human resources Sourcing inputs for Training of staff Test production Getting business license Launch 3.8 socioeconomic impact of the Investment Project Improving access to productive breeds and poultry feed would have a direct impact on maximizing economic benefits from the poultry sector currently ethiopians poultry sector is dominated by indigenous 91 per cent of all chickens are characterized as have low productivity Investing in a parent stock multiplication centre would increase access to improved breeds changing the current demography of the chicken population with more productive chicks With increasing production of docs prices are expected to decline which contributes to improving capacity of poultry farms this coupled with access to quality and affordable feed can 25 increase the economic value of poultry Poultry farms that are currently suffering from shortage of feed can be rejuvenated to resume and scale operations In addition poultry farming has the potential to improve household income in the rural community to the extent where it becomes the primary income generating activity This investment project has the potential to unlock that opportunity further it has the potential to positively impact thousands of maize and soybean farmers through its and contract farming programs The investment project will also create direct jobs at the poultry farm and feed processing facilities A model that includes building capacity of women and youths with the right skillet for poultry farming availing adequate resource of both DOCs and feed and creating linkages with the end market could be designed piloted in selected regions and then scaled to cover additional regions could be designed This kind of approach would create job opportunities to at least groups and more than women and youth by availing 20 per cent of produced DOCs and feed to this initiative In line with Ethiopian government objectives this investment is also both and and expands the potential to generate fore and become a catalyst of growth in the sector 3.9 Environmental impact assessment Appropriate measures must be in place to ensure insecurity at the poultry centre Unless safe and poultry rearing is practiced diseases could spread to other poultry farms in the country including the export market When commercial farms import parent stock one of the key decision factors in selecting the right supplier is insecurity of the farm from which they plan to source Producers usually refuse to import from companies that operate in countries where there are prevalent chicken diseases like influenza scares or new castle breakouts as these risks might result in mortality of chicken upon arrival or down the line in production proper waste disposal could also affect the environment especially negligence when disposing of biohazardous waste products could transmit viral diseases to other poultry flocks Poor cleaning practice might lead to the remnant of infectious materials on rearing facilities which will affect the next flock The proper handling of waste is essential to ensure an efficient and sustainable poultry farm as chickens especially exotic breeds are highly prone to diseases compared to other livestock To reduce this impact commercial farms typically burn hazardous waste including birds affected by a certain disease Other wastes like chicken manure are used as fertilizers in planting and gardening hence are given away or sold at cheap prices similarly waste from feed processing are usually processed into cattle feed production Poultry has the lowest cop emissions compared to other meat processing As a results environmentalists favour chicken meat and is considered by many to be the meat product of the future 51 Invest in the Ethiopian Poultry sector engage 2020 26 4. The Prospect of Setting Up a Grandparent Stock Management Centre One of the key levers of the poultry sector is having consistent access to parent stocks however there is no company in Ethiopia established to manage grandparent stocks from which parent stocks are produced currently rely on imported parent stocks from Europe we go netherlands and South America we go brazil The number of parent stocks in the country is 2021 was estimated to be about broiler breeder stock layer breeder stock and parent stocks The stock needs to be replaced with a new flock every 18 months Compared to demand in the market the amount of parent stock in the country is very low Access to fore has been the major bottleneck to consistently import parent stocks Ethiopia has a negative balance of payment which reached us 10 billion in fiscal years The scarcity of fore limits the number of parent stocks that can import to produce docs In addition cannot predict when fore could be results in overflow of DOCs when fore is released at the same time for queued This has contributed to price volatility in the market and has a negative that extends across the whole value chain Recognizing this challenge the Livestock Master Plan has identified improving the availability of chicken breeds in Ethiopia as one of the key intervention areas To resolve this challenge the lap had envisioned establishing one national and four regional grandparent multiplication centres in the country ultimately these farms would produce 440 million DOCs per years The government envisage to engage the private sector in such farms through promotion incentives business extension services and consumer training These plans have been carried forward in the current agricultural development plan To realize this goal it is important to build relationships with genetic companies There are a limited number of companies in the world that have the genetic material to operate and grandparent multiplication centres The engagement models of these companies range from country to country some they control management of the farm and in others they receive royalty payments for their supply of pure breeds One company interviewed has indicated that they have established two grandparent multiplication centres in Africa in West and Southern african While they are direct equity owners in ane company they receive royalty payment for their breeds in the other market Investing in grandparent stock management centre requires large investment and various requirements need to be met Depending on the size of the farm the investment might range from the tens of millions of dollars to the hundreds As a results commercial farms looking to invest in this 52 Invest in the Ethiopian Poultry sector engage 2020 53 Annual report National Bank of ethiopian 54 Ethiopia livestock master plan Ministry of agriculture 2015 55 Invest in the Ethiopian Poultry sector engage 2020 27 space consider various factors before factors determine whether a country offers a good value proposition and is viable from an investment perspective 1. Market maturity Industry experts indicate that producing parent stocks annually as the minimum threshold that makes grandparent stock management centre a viable business The Ethiopian market must be able to absorb at least this amount of production As indicated in the market assessment per capita consumption of poultry products in Ethiopia is low public and to work towards developing the market by implementing initiatives that improve nutrition we go school feeding programs and make eggs and poultry meat part of the normal diet in both rural and urban markets Multiplication farms might consider the export market focusing on East african as an additional market destination however because regional markets like Kenya and sedan have already established stable source of parent stock there is no strong business case for positioning Ethiopia as a regional hub 2. Infrastructure availability Parent stock multiplication centres need guaranteed water supply electric power communication and internet lines and road access for heavy transport for feed and live poultry The infrastructure needs to be stable and consistent to ensure smooth operation of the farm black of it would be costly for the investment additionally the investment would require hectares of virgin land that has not been allotted to poultry before to construct a facility The location must allow for managing insecurity risks we go no poultry farms must be found within 3.2 kilometer radius of the farm Finding a location that meets these standards is a daunting task 3. Human resources Since parent stock multiplication is and knowledge based investment it requires highly skilled and experienced individuals in the field which is currently lacking 4. Policy assurance Potential investors would need priority access to fore to import breeds medicines equipment etc Because the investment will be longterm investors need guaranteed land lease rates Import and export restrictions on genetics inputs etc might be detrimental to the operation of the parent stock farm To mitigate these uncertainties investors need flexibility in the application of policies that are currently operating in Ethiopia we go restrictions on DOCs and feed export import on importing maize and fore retention etc further policies must be in place to identify and control disease outbreaks In the the government can start discussions with global genetic companies and potential investors interested in the poultry sector in ethiopian While discussions develop the government in coordination with potential investors can explore how the requirements can be met With a view of establishing the first grandparent management farm in the foreseeable future five to ten years the government can work to lay the foundation work including identifying areas for potential development availing infrastructure and developing local talent 56 Parent stock handbook Arbor acres 2018 28 5. Recommendations Based on the business case assessment including analysis of the market potential and technical requirements of the investment project few recommendations that are important to improve the investment landscape in the poultry sector particularly related to improving access to breeds and feed can be inferred These recommendations include 1. Improve the market demand through continuous awareness creation campaigns one of the major challenges currently affecting the attractiveness of the market is the low per capita consumption of eggs and chicken meat in ethiopian There remains limited awareness of the nutritional benefits that poultry consumption offering both urban and rural communities Where lack of awareness drives low consumption the government must work with the private sector and development partners to create demand This might be accomplished through and awareness creation campaigns Education on nutritional benefits of poultry consumption could be delivered in schools hospitals and other public settings In addition marketing through advertising radio and television programs could be used as instruments to create demand These campaigns should include information about diversification of poultry consumption to break the cultural consumption of chicken meat and showcase how poultry could be integrated in the regular diet of ethiopians 2. Create linkages in the value chain to improve access to inputs for producers and eggs and chicken meat for consumers the cost of production for poultry feed as well as poultry farming is currently affected by poor linkages in the value chain There are several actors operating between producers and which are adding little value but contributing to increasing of affecting both producers and buyers Improving linkages in the value chain we go by creating a platform where inputs can be sourced directly from producers will reduce both uncertainties in the market and price of inputs thereby increasing the of quality feed and improved breeds On the other hands improving market linkages will allow small and farms to sell their products with better margins and improve their growth potential further such kind of market linkage will reduce wastage and foster healthy competition among poultry producers 3. Creatively work with poultry producers and associations to improve the investment environment and access to inputs while incentives are good instruments to attract investors in parent stock multiplication and feed processing there are several policy interventions needed to improve the investment landscape For example because investments in the sector is the risk of losing all stock due to lack of vaccines or high cost of feed investors would need preferential access to forest In addition lack of one type of input we go premium could halt production and jeopardize the whole operation adding to the need to have continuous access to forest The demand for fore could be partly satisfied by ensuring access to critical inputs locally For example are currently being exported by processors The government can facilitate buying arrangements between oiled processors and poultry feed producers and support in 29 formulating a deal that is attractive to all parties including buying inputs locally in foreign currencies further the government must provide a guarantee against sudden policy changes that might affect the operation of investments 4. With a longterm view carry out targeted investment promotion to attract parent stock multiplication centres and global feed processors The number of poultry genetics companies in the world are limited The government with the support of development partners need to develop a strong value proposition including identification of a site with strong insecurity for parent stock multiplication and implement a targeted investment promotion strategy to whet the appetite of investors This includes identifying genetics companies conducting missions negotiations signing Memorandum of Understandings and following up to ensure implementation of the intended investment projects Partnerships in the form of pops must be designed and explored with potential partners if this approach is found to be the most suitable 5. Employ a model towards investing in grandparent multiplication in ethiopian currently the government has a plan to establish five grandparent multiplication centres in ethiopian Countries that have higher per capita consumption of eggs and chicken meat in Africa have in most cases one or two grandparent multiplication centres Based on these learning there might be a need to revise the ambitious plan consolidate efforts and start with only one grandparent multiplication centre in the A pilot program could be implemented first then based on success scale it to meet local demand and potential export opportunities This approach reduces the investment risks and increases the likelihood of success Implementing the above recommendations will require a strong coordination between the government the private sector and development partners 6. Conclusion Based on the analysis establishing a parent stock multiplication and feed processing facility clearly brings positive economic and social benefits to many stakeholders including investors existing small medium and large poultry farms moreover increasing availability and of eggs and chicken meat has the potential to improve nutrition intake in ethiopian This business case study provides public and private stakeholders with insight and a starting point to engage with the right partners and further explore how it could be realized finally it should be noted that while this business case study endeavoured to provide a comprehensive picture of investing in the poultry sector in ethiopian potential investors are advised to strive to conduct an feasibility assessment before and build upon the information provided in this documents This will help investors fully understand the opportunities challenges risks and its impact and adapt the investment strategies accordingly to meet their objectives 30 Annex Annex List of stakeholders consultations informing this report interview Ethiopian Ministry of Agriculture Livestock Sector Development Division Ethiopian Ministry of Agriculture Poultry Development Directorate Ethiopian Ministry of Agriculture feed producer addis ababa Genetics and parent stock distribute The Netherlands Ethiopian Poultry Producers and Processors Association Ethiopian Investment Commission Investment Promotion Directorate International Livestock Research institute Livestock Scientist mara Enterprise development bashir Dar Poultry industry expert addis ababa feed producer aroma DOCs producer addis ababa feed producer aroma DOCs producer mara feed and DOCs producer addis ababa poultry farmers aroma region sendoff poultry farmers aroma region sendoff II poultry farmers aroma region poultry farmers aroma region II poultry farmers inner region harass poultry farmers inner region harass II Large retailer addis ababa Large retailer ii addis ababa Fresh produce distributor addis ababa chain restaurant restaurant focusing on fried chicken Surveys 150 consumers in different areas of addis ababa.
