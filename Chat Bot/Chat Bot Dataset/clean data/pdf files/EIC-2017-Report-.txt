investment in the textile and garment sectors could also be accounted as a factor of key infrastructure development interventions initiated by the government in electricity road and most recently industrial parks development programs What is more the dedication of over three million hectares of irritable land linked to the prevalence of favorable climatic conditions for the production of cotton is expected to play a key role in the country global competitiveness in textile production To this could be added that foreign market opportunities and in particular preferential access

Insight in to ethiopians Industrial Parks Development Program he to Former Prime Minister of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia at the Inauguration of harass Industrial park 13 July 2016 3.1 background Industrial Parks wipe Program Ethiopia is taking a range of policy and strategic measures to facilitate the move towards industrial development To this end the country has putin place an industrial park development program This is apart from the national endeavors to attract investment through the employ of the ordinary investment regime The IPs program has been integrated to ethiopians development vision under the Growth and Transformation Plan 11 and considered as important contributor to ethiopians goal of becoming a middle income country by 2025. Ethiopia sees industrial parks investment in strategic locations and sectors as generator of more jobs accelerator of increased and diversified exports earner of foreign currency means for greater transfer of technology and stimulator of socially and environmentally responsible urban development Ethiopia enjoys favorable conditions to meet these aggressive goals especially in the light manufacturing sector The country has one of the most competitively priced cost structures in the African Continent with regard to electricity labor and overall operational environment and production costs Within the above framework the Government s growth strategy emphasizes the development of Industrial Parks lips as an important tool to support economic diversification attract investment and increase exports The IPs scheme is especially relevant in the light manufacturing sector to create employment initiate export led growth encourage private investment attractions and stimulate benefits from integration with the local economy IPs are projected to be equipped with a streamlined business environment common services and amenities infrastructure and readily serviced industrial land All such arrangements have been made available to local and foreign companies through a single efficient and streamlined IP administration The plan for the expansion of existing facilities and development of additional IPs is buoyed by results of a speedy delivery of IPs as well as risk uptake by the public developer arm of the government the a services Gen Park furthermore the Ethiopian model of IPs development features generally recognized sound practices within a competitive environment combined with localized legal and operational practices to capture understanding and ease in implementation Salient benefits of the IPs program Sustainability environmental social o Rapid and massive job creation with tailored skills development . Penetration into and expansion of external markets oe Technology transfer o Linkages of IP production to local business leading to vertical integration . Introduction of a business friendly environment including boss Of key importance in the context of this process is the institution of a streamlined competitive and enabling environment for private investors through the establishment of the principle of separation of IP development and regulatory functions Introducing the strong features to the IP programs would eventually serve as a test lab to introduce reforms to the national territory following the Asian SEZ model The fact that ethiopians IP development strategy has been predicated on the experiences of and collaboration with fairly developed Asian economies ensures a bright prospect both to IP developers and individual tenants especially in the light manufacturing sector In laying out its IP development strategy goes focus has also included programs to ensure IP investors are able to quickly integrate into the local economy provide opportunities to local business to enjoy linkages with different IPs as business driven initiative and to make IPs investment more sustainable by stimulating higher value strategies to IP production The latter component is particularly dictated by international experience itwould be very difficult to pursue its implementation at a later stage if itwas not been duly considered at the beginning of IP Normally viewed as one of the key reasons why linkages programs for IPs are initiated it suffices to note theonly a few linkages programs have been successful around the world In this tune the epic has further emphasized working on complementary themes such as technology transfer labor training and overall social benefits undoing so Ethiopia is building competitive conditions required for a successful IPs development growth and expansion within an Ethiopian social legal and operational environment Development Ethiopia currently has five completed industrial parks Four publicly owned whole semi Industrial park harass industrial park industry Park and kombucha industrial park and one private eastern industrial park From the five hole semi IP and harass IP are operational while Eastern IP a private ip is also operational IP kombucha IP are already half full waiting for investors for the remaining space The government has put in place concrete plans to develop additional IPs during the period of An important development that demonstrates the level of market interest in ethiopians IP program is that seven additional IPs are already approved and currently under various phases of development The development of five private industries is also underway during the same period These are George shoes vogue check and can Industrial parks In addition a key aspect of the of ethiopians industrial parks program is the fact that the sector has been open for foreign investment and various government support measures has been putin to place Currently seven private industrial parks are under different levels of development andlor undergoing expansion PARKS specialization TEXTILE AND apparel .

Our goal is to create millions of new jobs in labor intensive and light manufacturing The full operation of the harass Industrial Park is the most evident and concrete example yet towards achieving our national vision harass will now and forever be a symbol of our national enterprise our bold move to industrialized our economy In we have been successful in building a industrial park featuring environmentally friendly technology But the key to success is not the infrastructure and factory sheds per see In fact that is the easiest part It is rather our progress in translating our vision into reality It is our achievement in attracting and hosting leading investors to establish manufacturing operations Most of these companies have now started operations and export and very soon harass will be a thriving industrial hub Our economy is also expanding ata robust pace and the world is watching our transformation closely and with keen interest A few weeks ago the World Bank forecasted that this year Ethiopia will be the fastest growing economy in the world similarly IMF called Ethiopia the star performer in the African continent this years Ethiopia has now become one of the largest recipients of FDI in the African continent Despite the decline in interest in the rest of african FDI flow in Ethiopia has increased by this years recent report by united concluded that Ethiopia is now the and largest recipient of FDI in textile and apparel next to vietnam Ethiopia is fast becoming an attractive destination for investment Our drive to create a competitive textile and apparel sector is advancing in the right direction indeed Ethiopia is emerging as a leading manufacturing hub in african The harass Industrial Park is also significant because it represents our blueprint in designing and developing an integrated park across the country We have learned a lot in the process of the development of this park from design to construction and finally to park s operation and management The harass Industrial Park has given us lessons and experiences as a framework in working procedures strategies speed of delivery and most importantly viability Using and improving upon our harass Industrial park model we are in the process of developing industrial parks across the country By virtue of being a model of sustainable and productivity for all subsequent industrial parks harass Industrial Park has created a conducive environment for the creation of jobs for Ethiopian youths across the country This achievement is a direct result of the shared vision among the government pah and other investors as well the government s unrelenting determination to stay actively engaged and adjust to arising trends and situations . Although our progress has not always been as smooth as we want it to be we have succeeded in developing an industrial park that has addressed the fundamental problems and constraints previously encountered Although the production inauguration of harass Industrial Park marks a milestone in our quest to industrialization we should note that our journey has begun Now is not the time to be resting on our laurels We must keep this hardhearted progress going We must continue to build on what we have done and strive to climb higher And the question now is how do we keep the progress going How do we build on it first want to underscore the government s firm belief that foreign direct investment has a critical role for manufacturing growth it makes significant contributions in terms of investment employment and foreign exchange Targeted and investments will enable us to expand the base of our economy and make it less likely that we will be affected by a downturn in the global economy additionally it enables the diffusion of knowledge and technology to domestic firms and workers Without new investment there can be no strong economy Without a strong economy we cannot sustain our growth and increase the income of our people This is why investors and anchors like those we have in harass are important contributors to our growth efforts They create a ripple effect to the whole economy The opening of this park will provide a major boost to existing retail commerce the hospitality industry and housing and real estate sectors strong manufacturing sector is therefore a vital ingredient to our growing economy While acknowledging the critical role of foreign investment we also need to emphasize the vitality to drastically develop the strategic manufacturing capabilities of domestic investors and ensure their viability today I m calling for all of regional city local officials and domestic industrialists universities and our come together to spark a renaissance of our manufacturing sector to support investments and to create new opportunities for cur youth so that they can achieve an improved quality of life Let s all be genuine partners to growth second believe our human capital will in the end drive our industrial productivity We need to understand that what we do today will have a direct impact on the competitiveness of our industry sector in the future To succeed in the manufacturing sector we must have a capable and productive workforce We need our workers to be skilled and disciplined Industrial discipline is essential for ensuring improved performance better productivity and an effective workforce Our trade unions need to work closely and in good faith with our investors to forge sound industrial relations and to maintain industrial peace atall times We also need to establish strong partnerships between universities and manufacturers where the flow of information can be facilitated to bring about an increased transfer of skills and technology third am directing every single agency in our government to work with a shared and urgent sense of mission to collaborate and create a vibrant plug and play business environment in the industrial parks We are now shifting to a new way of doing business within the governmental approach that delivers vision and actions and not just ideas and promises We need to cut bureaucratic red tape that stalls good investments from breaking ground Our service delivery to the investors should match the seriousness and the speed at which Ethiopia is pursuing this drive fourth we must make a concerted effort to ensure our manufacturing is globally competitive We know for example the textile and apparel sector is highly sensitive to cost and lead times of import and export If our trade logistics is not efficient our export will never be competitive and our industries will fail In this regard we is making steady progress For instance we are constructing a facility in mojo to allow for efficient cargo movement from rail to trucks and trucks to rail We ve made operational a modern high speed railway linking the country to the port still we can and have to do better Going forward we need to create a competitive logistics industry that reduces transit time modernize the sector provides more services and meets fully the users needs The availability of renewable and clean energy is important for all our investors Our utilities need to provide adequate reliable electricity and to avoid unreasonable power outages that could interfere with Without modern banking and financial services Ethiopia will not be a competitive investment destination Our banking industry need to continuously improve and optimize their services to provide tailored services to industrial parks to make our exporters internationally competitive Our banks should offer diverse financial products and services Our financial institutions need to modernize to keep up with global standards finally we need to create an ideal environment in harass that is conducive for visitors residents and investors to enjoy life and excel in their work When harass is clean and green that makes it a great melting pot for talent ideas investment and business opportunities We must harass attractive not just because of our lake and climate but also because of our facilities security connectivity and health standards When we address these issues and do more am confident that we will take harass to the next level of success and achieve our national vision of making Ethiopia the manufacturing hub of

knowledge and technology spillover Without strong manufacturing based we cannot build a strong and diversified national economy thats predicated on robust between the industry and agriculture sectors With the aim of realizing Vision 2025 and becoming the leading manufacturing hub in african we have made an extensive and targeted effort to attract and retain quality investors with sound capital and

industrial land however at the core of the enterprise in the phase of industrial parks also lies the need for the provision of a single efficient and streamlined one stop services to investors hence a mechanism must be put in place where governmental agencies work with a shared and urgent sense of mission and collaborate to create a vibrant plug and play business environment in industrial parks

platform both within and outside of hip Among others the park features a fully equipped One Stop Service building dedicated to bringing government facilities closer to industries ONE STOP SERVICE In

world While pah currently sources a large share of its garment from asian it is showing an increased interest to gradually shift its production base into East Africa a result of changing global economic dynamics such as increased cost of production in Asia and the fast economic growth with rising middle class society in african It is with this perspective that pah has recently established its own production plant in ethiopians harass Industrial Park the largest park in Africa located in the city of South of addis ababa pass direct investment on a fully vertically integrated supply chain in Ethiopia is a remarkable shift and the industry s in general usual business model of sourcing or contract manufacturing signifying the high level of trust the company puts on ethiopians investment climate and its grand plan of using Ethiopia as a manufacturing hub Recently interviewed on can Marketplace african Manny the CEO of phi gave a bullish testimonial of the excellence with which the Government of Ethiopia is implementing its industrial policy and parks development placing the country as a preferred destination for foreign global sourcing Asked how well pig s plan of creating a manufacturing hub in ethiopians harass Industrial Park is unfolding against the company initial expectations the CEO stated it is really a moving on plan and surprisingly moving very aggressively forward We are targeting first quarter of next year to actually begin production We are in the stages of factory being built and security and workforce at this time Africa for us represents of our global production So we have always been there We have seen the promise of Africa and the potential and we are trying to capture that now Further highlighting on the availability of skilled and traceable labour in ethiopian pig s CEO underlined there is an abundance of people and remarkably well educated It is a society that is really going into a transition from an society to a society and hopefully in the future towards economy So the key issue is job training It is just a little bit different than running a farm or working in an agricultural industry so that issue needs to be really focused Asked about investment opportunities and challenges the CEO affirmed that some challenges do exist but opportunities outweigh the challenges The biggest challenge we are going to face is Ethiopia is landlocked So the challenges would be making sure that infrastructure is in place to move the goods from factory to port But have to say at the point we are here we have always been a pioneer from a sourcing point of view We were keen we have started up in we have started up in China we really have been ahead of the curve ethiopian or East Africa in general is significantly ahead of where those other countries were at respective time pass CEO further underlined on the huge sourcing potential Africa presents to companies like pah asserting that there is a business case for them to gradually shift production and set a base in african We are targeting East Africa to represent in five years of our production To put that into perspective asian led by china and indian represent about of our production today We would like to diversify that and move a third of that production overtime into East african and really use that as a based We believe it will give us a competitive advantage if itis built appropriately it will give us speed to market capability that doesn t exist in Asia today Africa today only represents about million of our global retail sales for all of our brands which is almost billion small percentage but growing very fast Based on population size and if we develop the middle class group in african the potential for our brands to do commerce and sale our goods and become importers instead of just exporters is huge The CEO further stated that brands such as Tommy and Calvin Klein are of high initial growth opportunity for African markets since they are global brands with tremendous consumer recognition We will be producing some of those goods there with some of our other moderate goods we will start with using our eyes on and then move towards our brands There is really a demand that is going to be built up over time We have seen it happen in other parts of the world But the potential in Africa is huge The whole world has much to be excited about when it comes to our work in Ethiopia Bill Chief Supply Chain Officer for pah corps at the grand Production inauguration the harass Industrial park June 2017 HIP Human resource The competitiveness of the manufacturing sector in industrial parks greatly depends on the development of human capital and multidimensional initiatives carried out by various stakeholders to
